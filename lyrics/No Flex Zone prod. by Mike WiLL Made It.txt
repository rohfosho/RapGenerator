No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
Won a gold medal, and a gold bezel
I treat it so special, now ya ho jealous
Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go getter
Swae Lee, Lee Swae, it's the same difference
H2O, lean, same thing
Niggas throw sets and gang bang
Free everybody in the chain gang
Been two days since I laid down
Kool Moe Dee, five chains on
Mister T, them rings on, say my fucking name ho
Yeah, them diamonds so cool, yeah, that old school mine fool
Never heard about you, all my hoes, they so rude
Tats all on me nigga, trill ass individual
Don't check, I'm that nigga, sit on my Balmain zipper
Got a airtight schedule, fuck your bitch, just met her
Pink slip, no rental, got a L full of that killer
Beating on my chest, like Magilla
Nigga, I am the gorilla of the village
Pack sound like heavy metal
Just killed the haters, God bless them
Young niggas got to get to the money
Five chains on, they look at me funny
Showed up with the juice and the troops
Roll a seven every time I shoot
She said, why you have so many condoms with you?
I said, I'm a player, to be honest with you
Hublot, whoo, so shiny
Mind you, my crew right behind me
Went shopping, could've bought an island
Talking money, when I'm with Italians
Spilling purple, on the red carpet
And I'm flyer, than a nigga on a hang glider
4-5-6-7 chains on, just stay in your lane, ho
Don't you like these A. Wang's? Don't you like these gold fangs?
You a well known flexer, I'm a young trendsetter
These hoes, they reckless, they slick, they messy
Three hoes freak dancing, on the loud singing acapella
Chain clang, like heavy metal
Sremm killed the haters, God bless them
