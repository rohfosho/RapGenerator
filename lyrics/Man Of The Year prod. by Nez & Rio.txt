Bruh, I see, girls everywhere

Titty, ass, hands in the air, it's a party over here

Shake it for the man of the year

Uh, man of the year, man of the... bounce



Home of the party and the trees

Sunny land of the G's, please let a nigga breathe

Tank top top down for the breeze

Burnt lips, got a blunt full of weed, peace, love, enemies

Nigga I ain't come for the beef

You ain't know she came for the skeet? Got pipe for the cheeks

Nigga, I'm the life of the beat

Fuck that, this year gotta eat, bounce for the crown

You be hating and I still hold it down

When you round man the girls never lounge, man I heard you a hound

Bruh, man, that bitch need a pound

Tip-tip-tip bounce out her gown, hands high to the sound

Uh, yeah, I'm the rich nigga now

Bitch, I'm the talk of the town, make a bitch run her mouth

Go south for the boy

Pop down to the floor... bounce





Home of the slanging on the curb

Weed cards every corner sell herb, what's a fly to a bird?

Nigga, I could pitch you a curb

Let this real shit occur, make mills from a verb

Nigga cop a crib in the burbs, nigga

You ain't said nothing but a word, smoke something for ya nerve

Home of the paid on the first

Then nigga going broke by the third, bounce for the crown

Fast forward getting real tell me now

Every dog need a cat to meow, every once in a while

I see hands in the crowds

See whites, blacks blazing a pound, jumping around

Tits, ass bump out her gown

Bounce from the ground, hype for the sound

This verse straight from the morgue

Pop down from the floor... bounce
