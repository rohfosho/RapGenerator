Making of the Beat w/ Cam



Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank

I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank

I miss my cocoa butter kisses

I miss my cocoa butter kisses



Okie dokie, alky, keep it lowkey like Thor lil bro

Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi

Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote

If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie

Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie

I just opened up the pack in an hour I'll ash my lucky

Tonight she just yelling, "fuck me," two weeks she'll be yelling fuck me

Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie

And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me

Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me

Oh generation above me, I know you still remember me

My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting (BLAM!)





(Innanet)

I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale

Everywhere that I go, everywhere they be asking hows it going

Say the goings well, go figure, Victor's light skinned

Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God

God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL

Check, check mate, check me take me to the bedroom, let you know me well

I mean normally, you see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil

But these kids these days, they get so high, burn trees, smoke chlorophyll

'Til they can't feel shit, shit-faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L

Elevated, train, and the craziest thing

Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated

Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it

Probably shoulda been dead or in jail

Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz

Asshole, absynthe up in that glass

Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong

Rip, brain dead, take a tug and then pass



I think we all addicted

Yeah, I think we all addicted

Really though, I think we all addicted

I think we all addicted



Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank

I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank

I miss my cocoa butter kisses

I think we all addicted





I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter - juicy

Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi

Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie

I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi

You see, I be still a God but a goofy

You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi

That's the new principle, sometimes I'mma be about some hoes

Sometimes I'mma wanna make a movie

And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson

And though my style freakish

I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron

Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG

Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope see

Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics

Cooler like I'm offa codeine, low key

Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing

If I don't know what I miss is

I'ma end up figuring out that it's home

And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses

This is just a testament to the ones that raised me

The ones that I praise and I'm thanking

I need em but the chronic all up in my clothes

And I wanna get a hug, and I can't cause I'm stanking

Never too old for a spanking, igh
