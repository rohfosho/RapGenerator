Suicideyear, Sad Boys
Shawty Ima do things that you ain't never did
Finna wake up next to you, in my crib, cause
I'm a' make you hurt
I'm a' I'm a' make you hurt
Sad Boys, we on deck
"Am I awake?", I got to check
Went to sleep, then I came back
I'm the same guy smoking loud pack
Iced out, right back, PCP attack
Greedy pills hoes, on my ball sack
They don't know how to act
High tech watch, high tech locked
Broken skies, fantastic fox
Got keys, but I'll never find the lock
Emotion boys we in the UFO
Skies pink when I'm on ecstasy
In Tokyo, playing Mario
Sad Boys blast your stereos
Sucking on my nuts like pistachios
Mixing champagne with Carpaccio
Slangin dough, Ho I'm in that polo
Stacks of money, more for you
Milkshakes with the crushed up oreos
I'm in Italy, Rodeo
Forgive me after my death, Caravaggio
Louis duffel bag filled with heroin
Louis goons who finna trip on LSD acid tabs, let them in
Louis duffel bag filled with heroin
Louis goons who finna trip on LSD acid tabs, let them in
Bitch I light up the sky, call me Charmeleon
My life's on the line
I ain't Charmander, but I'm nearly on, clearly on drugs
That will make you hear clearly wrong
Longer than my yearly bong hit
Shawty thinks she's guest star Lean
Lean Doer dresses slicker
I'm so iced out that it's Winter
Destroy my stupid liver
I be on that bape shit, you rocking Quicksilver
Never hesitate, shit, to pull the trigger
Luxurious, ate before my dinner, throw Bombay down the river
Yea, you get that picture
Gold and silver around my finger
Shorty on that West Side, she a gold digger, wake up
And I'm a winner, showering in five star
Ho take that look in the mirror, I'm on my grind
Like all the time, Bitch I'm Murakami
Shawty sucking on my pastrami, Get that salami
Louis duffel bag filled with heroin
Louis Louis Louis duffel bag filled with heroin
Louis Louis Louis duffel bag filled with heroin
Sad Boys
