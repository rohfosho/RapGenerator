Jay-Z: You ain’t got enough stamps in your passport to fuck with Young H.O

Ice Cube: Dada Dada

Jay-Z: International

Ice Cube: Papa Dock

Ice Cube: What up Jay

Jay-Z: Show young boys how to do this thing

Ice Cube: You know me, Ice Cube, I'm like a Glock nigga, I always got a hot sixteen, knamean



I was a young lad of seventeen

My life had yet to show its ugly face

Only a pretty façade, hey God it's me

Remember three, thousand

The one who used to pray to be a rapper

My child's in the third grade

His favorite rapper wasn't rapping till he heard me

I wasn't rapping till I heard something called Erik B

And Rakim's Paid in Full

Rapper's really gettin' paid in full

So full that the kid's dont go to school in hopes of becomin' one of us

The only requirement is your bus

Now college is lookin' slim, product is hookin' them

Before their brains fully develop they get enveloped by the the vision tele

The television tells them their vision

Now it's hard for them to make decisions with out feelin'

Uncooled, unschooled, thumb rule

Rule of thumb, can't be dumb

I wish I would've studied abroad

Well I studied a broad and she studied me back

And my course was hard

That was that, this is this, listen up

Cause all I'm saying is

If thirty's the new twenty, thirty's the new twenty for them wheels as well

They lookin' for the mic or some pills to sell

While the girls are steady graduatin'

Nigga's standin' on the corner hatin', debatin'

Well should I get the new J's or the Kobe's

And they rollin' so they wide awake for four days

Ha, I'm a G-entleman, let's get re-aquainted

I am Andre Benjamin



I used to let my pants sag, not givin’ a fuck

Baby boy, now I’m all grown up

I used to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck

Baby boy, now I’m all grown up

I used to play the block like that

I used to carry knots like that

Now I got black cards, good credit and such

Baby boy, cause I’m all grown up, ha



Ya’ll roll blunts, I smoke Cubans all day

Ya’ll young’uns chase, I’m Patron' it straight

I like South Beach but I’m in St. Tropez

Ya’ll drink Dom, but not Rose’

Hey, ya chick shop at the mall

My chick burning down Bergdorf’s

Comin' back with Birkin bags

Your chick is like, what type of purse is that

I’m from the era when niggas don’t snitch

You from the era where snitchin' is the shit

I’m afraid of the future

Ya’ll respect the one who got shot, I respect the shooter

Ya’ll go to parties to ice grill

I go to parties to party with nice girls

Young boys gotta chill, thirty’s the new twenty, nigga I’m so hot still





Jay-Z, what can a young motherfucka tell me

About the LAPD, about the air that we breathe

Nothin', nada, zero, zilch

I want tits for fun, you want tits for milk

I'm all leather and silk, your fuckin' t-shirt look like a quilt

Playground king, climb the monkey bars that I built

Thirty's the new twenty, Phantom's the new Bentley

Nigga, dont tempt me, I'll bury you up in Tempe

And if I catch a ghost rider, tie him to a tree, gasoline like the lighter

Burn, you motherfuckin' fighta, treat you like George Bush treat Al-Qaeda

This is Guantanamo, think I'm a ho, I made the honor roll, mixed with Geronimo

Before this mic will pass, learn how to wipe your nose before you wipe your ass
