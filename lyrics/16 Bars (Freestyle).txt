Yo, Look
I don't follow no trends
But I'm a beast and I'm hyped
Soul assassin, all I need is a beat and a mic
Like Joseph Jackson
When I kill it, I feel so alive
And I get high so much that I don't know goodbye
So what's the word?, I'm down to earth but i was 'posed to fly
Life threw for me a lil' cool roller coaster ride
I never complain, I never play the blame game
Fuck the world, my dick hang like a crane chain
In other words I'm ready
My teachers thought I was sharp, my every word's a machete
Who goes there? Have no fear, it's just I
Who showed you what you can't see with just eyes
I kept it justice and poetry over beats and hoaxes
My city win like the Chicago beat
I took a chance and rapped like I'm a Chicago breed, for realer
If I ain't the most dope, than it's Mac Miller
'Coz these days I wear many faces
Rollin' up a drough tree Californicatin'
