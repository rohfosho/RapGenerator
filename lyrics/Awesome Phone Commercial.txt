Georgie Porgie used his 4G

Group text to set up an orgy

It's not just a smart phone, it's a Mensa

So healthy it's made of polenta

Not expensive and it tastes great

It'll help you lose weight

Lames can't hate

The phone is a boat and the boat's ship shape

I wish we could date

It's so tip top

It's magic and amazing and it won the Civil War

Singlehandedly for the North

So hip hop, ask Rick Ross

He's got twelve

You could write to Santa, you could mug an elf

We should called it iBate

Put the phone to vibrate

Stick it in my pocket then I touch myself

Add the Bluetooth undies

And I can steady talk it up

When I be talking out my behind

Get it get it get it

And then I get it again and again

You get a dozen of them

And be buzzing like a beehive

Is like an ancient demigod

And I love it and I grovel at the feet of it

And when it rings I leave it little offerings

And all the mortal imitators got to go

It's hotter than a habenero pepper in a lava flow

I was lame and afraid

But now I get laid

And now I get paid

It's better than competitors

And spreading like an epidemic

And you better get it or you're going to get AIDS
