Asap, ch-ching, and this is for my niggas, high
Who be fucking with them bitches for real, wha?
I say fuck 'em dog, fuck 'em dog, cause I don’t need 'em
I say fuck 'em dog, fuck 'em dog, that’s how I treat 'em
I just fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all and then I leave 'em
I’m a fucking dog, fucking dog, she know I’m beastin'
I say
They love the shit they like it, when it’s nasty they excited
Get possessed by my spirit and they ain’t tryna fight it
Leave these scratches on my back, my neck they love to bite it
On top they love to ride it, go dumb when I’m inside it
I throw thousands on that mattress, then drown them in my passion
Converse about some action, then I make them mount on me backwards
Mo scream, shout please, everything must happen
Mo please, mo please, cause she just gon keep asking, what?
Girl do it like you tryna get a fucking ring
See this your chance to be the queen, come and fuck the king
See this the chance to live your dreams, come and fuck with me
Fantasy lifestyle, give it to you right now
I can give you what you want, every time I see you
And I can give you what you need every time I see you
And make it feel like we in love every time I see you
But you know that I gotta leave and you know the reason
I’m a motherfucking dog, a motherfucking beast
Ok that’s your broad, well keep that bitch up on a leash
I tell that bitch to wipe her paws, when she get up in my sheets
Keep that bitch on all fours, she deserve a doggy treat
I’m a motherfucking dog, a motherfucking beast
Skeet, skeet, she a motherfucking freak
I don’t even play for keeps, I exchange her in a week
I return her like my jeans, I told him motherfuck receipts
Tell her pop that pussy like trill ho, money, money, money, I kill for
Move them squeeze no feel though, she can fiend dancing no heel toe
Her boy toy, no dildo, good brain but she still slow
She a bimbo, now my 10 4, get it triller but it’s only on the real though
I can give you what you want, every time I see you
And I can get you what you need every time I see you
And make it feel like we in love every time I see you
But you know that I gotta leave and you know the reason
