Oh, oh, luxury

Chidi-ching-ching could buy anything, cop that

Oh, oh, collard greens

Three degrees low, make it hot for me, drop that

Oh, oh, down with that shit

Drink this, smoke this, get down with the shit

Hey, oh, oh, down with the shit

Cop this, pop this, down with the shit



Smoke this, drink this, straight to my liver

Watch this, no tick, yeah, I'm the nigga

Gang rap, X-mas, smoke, shots I deliver

Faded, Vegas, might sponsor the killer

Shake it, break it, hot-hot for the winter

Drop it, cop it, eyes locked on your inner object

Rock it, blast-blast, new beginnings

Lovely, pinky how not I remember, fiending

Give me, give me, give me some

Freak the freckles off your face, frenchy, freaking, swapping tongue

Click my link and spread your buns, loose your denim, make it numb

Blow it baby, no Saddam (Icky-icky, icky-icky)

Fucking in the car service, thank me for the car pool

Chromosome, part full, prolly off a Norco

And gas, not the Arco, popping since the intro

You shopping from the window, play my favorite tempo





Hold up, biatch, this your favorite song

Translation: Ven aqui, mami, ese culo

Tu quieres cojer mis huevos, y papi me desespero

Chuparse puto pendejo, el pinche cabron - let's get it

Nights like this, I'm a knight like this, sword in my hand, I fight like this

And I'm more than a man, I'm a God, bitch, touche, en garde

Toupée drop and her two tits pop out of that tank top and bra

And when I say "Doo-doo, doo-doo," bitch, that be K. Dot

She want some more of this, I give her more of this, I owe her this

In fact, I know she miss the way I floored this, I'm forgis

I know my Houston partners, drop a four on this

And focus, and slow it down, alright, let me blow this bitch

I'm famous, I blame this on you, cash in the mirror

Hang in my penthouse roof, skyline the clearest

Watch it, your optics, popping out, you look the weirdest

Pop my top on the 105, head with no power steering, ah!





Bummy nigga famous, straight from the bottom

Broke niggas hate it, still never robbed him

Guns in the basement, out they have a problem

Kush be my fragrance, we love marijuana

Function on fire, burn the roof off this mothafucka

Psych ward is balling, go craze like no other

Weed steady blowing, pass the blunt to my momma

Runs in the family, puff-puff keep a nigga fiending

Faded, faded-faded right

Shot glass super size, she gon' get some dick tonight

Meet me at the W, and no it's not the Westside

Stick it up ya Southside (Icky-icky, icky-icky)

Baller futuristic, groovy gangsta with an attitude

What these niggas make a year, I spend that on my daughter shoes

Smoking weed and drinking, all the college students loving Q

We gon' turn it out until the neighbors wanna party too
