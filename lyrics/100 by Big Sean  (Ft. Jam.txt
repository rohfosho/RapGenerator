As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 100 things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 100 things to do before I die
Wonderin’ if I could live it all in one life
Cause it could all end in one night
As I look up to the sky
I thought about a 100 things to do before I die
Couple niggas on the hitlist and bitches on a different type
Same shit different nights, till I live a different life
Sean you looking tired, damn homie that’s all
I’ve been stressin’ so hard I’m surprised I ain't going bald
Haters praying I fall, move back in with my moms
Take online classes and turn back into ya’ll, hatin’
I guess they want your lights out when you the plug
Niggas wanna catch you slippin like they pulled the rug
From where they move the drugs, Buddha love
Niggas sleepin with that mac and I ain't talkin’ bout computer love
Owe the wrong people you a price tag
Now you pray to God hoping that you got a Christ tag
Make it where I’m from, stay who I become
Time to raise hell, Satan ain't my son
Taking elevators straight up out the slums to a penthouse view
And have the fam there too
If I just stop breathing
Even though I got all this muthafucking money
Won't keep my heart beating
Just don’t wake me up
Don't wake me up
You can’t catch me dreaming
Bout all of this muthafucking money
Cocaine rush, I’m speeding
Cocaine rush
I’m just a Detroit nigga, nothing extra about me
I go extra hard at the first second you doubt me
I strive for perfection at the same time
I’m accepting the fact that there’ll never be nothing perfect about me
Shit, I’m just waiting on a win
Come up with better hooks
The hoes’ll take it on the chin
We are 6 mile bred
That's why you see our sick style yeah
Crackhouse flow with a pit downstairs
Momma happy at me, Daddy happy at me
The baddest chicks' y'all can imagine is chatty yapping at me
5 years ago I was in tears in the back of a paddy wagon
Now I’m Cali swagging, my nigga listen, I’m over the fame
You number 1, I’m number 23, my mission is take over the game
You rollin’ with lames, we ain't rolling the same
I’m the best out in this muthafucker
If I could get a check out of this muthafucka
Big enough to set my kids up for life
I could check out of this muthafucka with no regrets
If you ain't living your life for your kids
I ain't giving yo ass no respect
Sean I love you my nigga, I’m out
I gotta break your fucking heart
I gotta climb these fucking charts
I gotta do something that’s innovative
Creative just to create a legacy before death do us part
I gotta spend one summer in Tijuana with Tia and Tia’s momma
Breakfast in bed is head with plenty of Carne Asada
I gotta find me a wife to elope
I got a fine, cause I ain't wanna vote, I promise
I know the history of those who died for the rights for me to survive
But those who lied to the minority will make em turn inside they grave
I can easily pretend like y'all but that's not me
I gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt the youth
Need to know every detail about this Earth
The devil controls it
So before you scrutinize how I feel
Ask God if them polls important
The end is near
