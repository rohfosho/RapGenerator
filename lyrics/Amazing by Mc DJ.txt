Cool like a summertime pool in the winter

A nigga on fire, what he have for dinner

I bring home the bacon, call me breadwinner

I beat up the tracks so they call me track killer

I (?) for real-a, I heat like gorillas

So if you don't believe me you feel-a

I gotta get the million dollars

If you don't see me holla

If you tryin' to get then you swallow

I'm high as a kite, I feel fantastic

A girl on my dick so she call me nasty

I gotta make sure that my dick's in plastic

Or else I'm gonna end up inside a casket

Who the fuck's you? They call me Sick Boi

Got the Andre fever, get like Big Boi

If you try to get the kryptonite on me

You're gonna have to D.I.E



Chorus

The nigga is amazing

(It's Sick Boi, it's back)

The nigga is amazing

(Y'all know who it is)

The nigga is amazing

(Get wildin' like me)

The nigga is amazing

The nigga is amazing

The nigga is amazing

The nigga is amazing

The nigga is amazing



I put down the pen, no more writin'

So when I die they can remember me like the Titans

Call Michael Chrichton cause I'm like Congo

If you don't believe me you can suck on my bongo

I used to drive a hondo now I'm on the subway

Now my pocket's thick like that dude from Subway

You can have a hunday, better yet a milly

I'm not Lil Weezy but my pocket size silly

My wrist not chilly, I only sport Clockers

Got the purple hoody and the purple Gobstoppers

My momma used to tell me I was lost like (?)

Now I got the yellow truck like my name Tonka

My girlfriend ass stay fit like J-Lo

Girl and my money stay thick like Play Doh

Got to philosophize my mind like Plato

What'd y'all say though?



The nigga is amazing

(See I don't play around)

The nigga is amazing

(See when I say I'mma do something)

The nigga is amazing

(I say I do something)

The nigga is amazing

The nigga is amazing

The nigga is amazing

(Yo do this for real though)

The nigga is amazing

(I'mma try to kick it for real)

The nigga is amazing



Nigga I'm blazing

Nigga I'm amazing

Haters on the side line tellin me they hate me

Girls wanna date me, boys think I'm crazy

Girls always chase me like they Chasing Amy

I wanna be the play date, but if you have one

You can call me, on my cell phone

I don't believe it, I don't gotta see it

And if you don't see nothing you can sync up my penis

Women are from Venus, men are from Mars

And I'm walking down the street, while you drivin in cars

Cause I want everybody to see my new kicks

My hat broke off and my hoodie so sick

I used to know this chick, she used to be lame

Now she listen to me, now she usin' her brain

Yo I go to Bellevue cause my flow is insane, man



The nigga is amazing

(I said stay wildin' like me boi)

The nigga is amazing

(I came back with a vengeance)

The nigga is amazing

(I put down the pen so I could focus again)

The nigga is amazing

(S'why I don't write shit)

The nigga is amazing
