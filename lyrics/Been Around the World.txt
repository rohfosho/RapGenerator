Don't cry dry your eyes call me a jerk
Not cause the size of my jeans but how I hurt ya
I know this relationship is never gonna work
But I plant thoughts in your head that only do ya dirt
And I said this once before, we make the perfect team
We barely get along forever making scenes
Your crying on my sleeve what does it really mean
It doesn't really matter to me
Cause I go, I go all around the world
Fuck different girls, cause when they see ya boy
They scream and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me
Cause I know, I know there's the perfect girl
Who I can share my soul with but I can only see
In my dreams and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me
Now you can cry me a river or cry me a ocean
Maybe the Pacific, that's just to be specific
I gotta keep it pimping these hoes they say I'm tripping
I don't care about your nails and your new hair, do your lipstick
Dip-dip next ho, they be on my dick like
All on my testicles, I can't even piss right
After we fuck you won't see me again after this night
Real niggas know what I mean
Now you can go go where you want front who the one gotta get that vibe
Did I hit that? Quit that? How did I hit that? Niggas know how I keep it live
Live try this suprised but she just say I'm on her eyes
Whenever get it in that Prada or Del Agua
Now I be the man Peter Pan, I fly high cause you like my drift
She know how I do it cause I got possess and I'm so swift
Get her girlfriend in this whirlwind how we spin
It don't really matter cause I'm pimping bitch until the end
