[Verse 1: Chester Watson]
So I'm high as fuck and probably out in London
At the Royal watching practices for [?]
I'm still high as fuck
And diving in pious, starting riots, let the fire snuff
Lungs mellow, clouds, and the lighter, I spark it
Got homies that have seen more lines than a Hyperdunk
Get it? I'm on time for the rising
And if I'm online bet a dime that I'm writing
While the plot's thickening, liquor shots quickening
Hopscotch into the drop docks with a million
Suckers foregut, sizzle, reluctant to pluck fiddle sticks
Little dick niggas erupting for Dutch brittles
Clean as the villain is venomous, rekindling
Chilling with the clutch, take a puff, let the dutch kiss him
But he the Dutch man, black Darth Vadar shit
No DJ but first person watch the fader switch
Baking up, relaxing in a green hat
Brash on my shadow lord tip, so you can mother fuck your feedback
And tell 'em take his head, he don't need that
Guillotined but his memory's never leaked, fact
Please, lean back like it's 04
Got a steam pack, gas shit is so loco
Going harder than paparazzi for close photos
The US is debating the kamikaze to ochos
But I don't fuck with these niggas
I got the whole sect to cover, why fuck with these niggas?
Just cause I'm stuck with these niggas? Bucked and a buck-fifty, slipping
Mind is sharper than rationalizing cutlery, usually not
But she bat her eyes cause she loving me, I asked her
She didn't deny, so I grabbed her thighs cause she's lovely
Corrupt Youth has been satanized with buttons
Wooki getting nookie, no cut, never sanitize the muttons, G
But that's just how it is, strike like paladins
And kill 'em all before the white knights invite cowardice
Chilling with a Valerie, showing her where valor is
Beat it, leave, and then ricochet to the alley
The demon who dares to face Zeus, hey, at the outing
Them dudes say, "Just look at her booty, it's astounding"
Check, he's with a smooth, sly heroine
June bug finish, two puffs so the snare'll hit
More Ds, potent chlorine causing ? cleanse
Out of bud, so the white papes got a narrow twist
To 'em, it's inherent I need a therapist
Cause sharing is caring and apparently I could spare the wits
Aliens, oh my gosh, I'm a paleontologist
Get the gist of what I say but never get what I meant
When I said that I had spent all of my grip
To go and get more cause money earned is just money flipped, son
Brag about a bitch, but you get none
Brag about your shit and get hit up
The models flock, but the throttle pop
No iPhone, got an Android with a OtterBox
It sucks to suck, but I don't really even use it
I never pay attention, I'm too busy with the music
Or I'm high as fuck
And writing gold on the iPod, no Midas touch
He fortified and people fear him like he Horus eye
Morphing to the lord, black sword and porcupine
Roofless, ruthless, Almaic and fruitless
The new kid, but he archaic with usage
Scarface of the future, but I been chilling with Shakespeare
We eating a parfait at Hooters
Scarf it down, now I'm parched, where's the juice
New rules, no peace, foul play's in the zoot, bitch
