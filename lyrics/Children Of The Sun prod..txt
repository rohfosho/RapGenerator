Listen, we the children of the sun, nigga, shine brighter

He the beatmaker, I'm the rhymewriter

Yo, check your cell, I got it locked like a crime fighter

I scribble legends of the future, I'm the time writer

Walking through the broken pieces

I break bread with gangsters, bankers, bosses, reach the unspoken speechless

Whole court of the streets, middle finger to my teachers

Flirting with the bitches in the bleachers

Ooh, what's new? Heard you been working on some ill shit

Niggas say y'all bringing back that real shit

That's right - yo, let me get my moment, time to put the bitches on it

When you stacking dollars, saving money you'se a big component

Me, I'm in it to own it, ain't fixated on no short shit

Niggas don't like it, fuck 'em with a horsedick

Who drop heaters? of course, Vic

Niggas making their music constipated, they force shit

I let it flow, inhale the weed then let it go, that medical

Grown niggas can't get into places I already go, my nigga let it go

You scary otter, I'm Harry Potter, you petty Peter Pettigrew

Ain't never tripping about a silly ho

Said listen when I start ripping, but holla if you hear me though

I fuck hoes, eat cheerios

Said she'd cook me breakfast, but I told her I'd be strizzy with some cereal

Here we go, hold up, hold up - let me get back, watch your back

In the city where the semi klick klack

Oh, read it, my nigga interview that

SaveMoney to the front, get with them or move back

Oh yes, it's KTD, we in the trap

She said she like the way I rap

Girl you should see me in the sack

Oh, now drop it back low

Swimming in the women like a tadpole

Know a couple hoes be doing mad blow, it's sad, yo

I put it to the back burner, habitual sack burner

Revolution; Nat Turner

Fast learner and regular cash earner

Trying to turn the game into some different shit

Spit that shit reflect the situations that we livin' with

Tell 'em something significant, get us out of this deficit

Up from out the oppressive shit, off of all of that extra shit

I ain't saying that shit ain't cool, we just need less of it

This is the New Testament
