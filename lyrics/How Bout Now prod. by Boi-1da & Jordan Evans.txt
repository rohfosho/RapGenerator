[Intro]
"That's the shit I'm talking 'bout though, like you changed up, you don't even fuckin' link nobody no more, you just dash me away like a cyattie. Yo, you cheesed me dog."

[Verse 1]
Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out
To see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you
Shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember? I deleted all my other girls' numbers out the phone for you
Remember? When you had to take the bar exam
I drove in the snow for you
You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you

[Hook]
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then
But how 'bout now?
Cause I'm up right now, and you stuck right now
Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then
Girl how 'bout now?
Cause I'm up right now, and you stuck right now, yeah
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl
How 'bout now? Yeah
Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?
What about now, girl, how 'bout now?

[Interlude]
My heart belongs to you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain't even say thank you
I had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like "who's this?" I be like "me, girl"
You be like "oh, word, true shit?"
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
And car rides made me feel like I was losin' it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Or I was average like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been

[Hook]

[Outro]
My hearts belongs to you
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do (x4)
