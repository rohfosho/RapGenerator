I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby

But this song so fuckin' dope, girl, it's harder not for me to blaze it

To tell the truth, wish it was you in this booth that I was blazin'

So I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby



See I've been in the studio just tryna get to you, baby

All night layin' verses though I'd rather lay with you, baby

Bra and panties matchin', nail and toes, you all kinda lady

Angel out of Heaven, such a goddess have a nigga prayin'





You need a real nigga, shorty so come in, throw that pussy, shorty

See I think you and me can make it, this little verse to get you naked

See, your heart ain't meant for breaking, Cupid's never been mistaken

See, I been caught up in the moment, shit, my type ain't quite her type

But now this gangsta nigga on it, she can twist my weed and hit the 'yac

I can hit your type without the hat, put that pussy on the map

I see qualities in a bad girl, I know that ass you got

Come with attitude and your swag, girl, you ain't wrong, girl

Just when that door knock lose your thong, girl

Cause you girl, cause you girl, girl, cause you girl, girl





Throw a loc your pussy, girl, you knowing that your nigga faded

Can I hit that pussy way I wanna while this record playing?

Put my tongue in different places, play a game of Operation

Na-na-na, la-la, la-la, you get what I'm saying

No metaphors, nothing like that

I'm keeping it straight to the point with you

I'mma put this dick up all in-side-of-you
