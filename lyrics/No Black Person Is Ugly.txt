No black person is ugly
No black person is ugly
No black person is ugly
No black person is ugly
Make another dime a day, tryna make it rhyme away
Sometime my skin is the reason I'm alive today
Bigger than just a race, no card, just a race
No smile, fix your face, we all live in this place
Tryna make peace with the police
I'm not on probation so why you out asking me
This is not just about black, or wasn't about black
When we talk about that you wonder why I talk back
My English not perfect, I'm not the best at school
But understand I'm (?), I love life's rules
Homeless people will even give me money, I'm too real for the game
Reflection of the fame
I got cash, I hide all the pain
Your skin black people, they won't say a thing
That drama is a shame
They wanna kill you before they even know your name
Sunshine, sunshine, lookin' for the sunshine
No black is person is ugly, don't say it one time
No black is person is ugly, don't say it one time
No black is person is ugly, don't say it one time
I'm sorta like a panther, I'm silent like the underground
Dealing with the trials of life, how did we get here today?
Black people not showed in the media
I was told that you gotta afro, that you gotta big nose
That your lips are too big, that you're talking low
My people understand, so why you don't know?
It's just communication
If we all sat down and got past the revelations
The future of the people
Advancement, tryna take chances, the media
Propaganda, it slandered the black beauty
I'm not stupid, I see it everyday
They got shows like Jailbreak but won't help you get straight
I'm tryna see black on more magazines
On the streets, the hoods that you're claimin'
Never been racist so I understand if you wanted
Try to change places
I've seen the other side and I know that's amazin'
Life is amazin'
They want you to work to enslave you
They try to trick you to think they made you
Ya'll got a voice, stand up against violence
If it's close to your home, stand up against rape
No means no, clean up the streets
You feel me? And stop that beef
Hands up for peace on the streets
