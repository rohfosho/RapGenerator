[Verse 1]

Yo

Yo
I don't really love but I laugh a lot
Camelots looking like a broke down Basquiat replica
Everyone left the building except for us
Get stoned and see the world in shades of sepia
Who's next to us? No one
Chester samurai but only half of the shogun
Brash is a clone cuts deep in the soul on a stroll as he goes nuts
Peep the control of composure
Chrome for appendages
Thrown into scrimmages
The unstable mind fights the drones to the bitter end
Oh now you chilling kin folk?
As the niggers spit folk
So wise tale hopes been cloaked by the brides veil

[Hook]
No chain get slain like the albatross
Chilling out chomping lo mein watching Avatar
Wax heated up with propane now I'm at the stars
Vibing out going insane like the battle scars

[Verse 2]

I met this new babe and she's awesome, rolled an L
With the king size papes that she bought me
Now I'm higher than Dionysous
With grapes at his alter
Eating good got a grilled cheese baked
So I'm feeling pretty great
And I could have called it fate as a master
Swagger dark back more arc than a raptor
Never see results cause we snarf at the factors
Told the crew "Watch out, it's barf in the rafters"
But I keep it clowning like a frail dunce
Worst feeling ever like opening up a stale blunt
(Damn)
This was just bad timing
On the road to glory
New Age Vandelay Psymun
Switch camera sway slightly
The antagonist of life
Super villain must remind your last shining
While the cam resolves
That shit was vivid as the smokescreen and analog
Heroining feening off the demons wearing camoflage

[Hook]
