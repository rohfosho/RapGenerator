[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Back when I first grabbed that pen
I told myself I was gon' win
And I ain't know when
But it was gon' end
Up happening, I want in
So you can take your top 5 list
Dead or alive, and put me after Em
I'm a fucking genius
Gripping my fucking penis
Living this life
You can't tell me nothing
Still ain't really got no money, fucking right
I'm all about that real, about that real
This ain't no motion picture
I tell you how that feel, how that feel
Even when the odds against you
They wanna see me wearing Polo drawers
Put two chains on and that ain't wrong
But that ain't me, I go too damn hard
I don't need clothes or jewelry to stand out
Black lip nigga with his hair wild
Too damn proud
Been killing this since Cam made "Oh Boy"
Oh boy, I'm the man now
TDE, put the money in my hand ain't shit free
This business is quick sand and I won't sink
Put the pistol in my hand and I won't think
Rest in peace, you just made room for the next to be
I never been afraid to say what I wanna say
When I wanna say it, okay then
Further more we do this for y'all
Rap is stressing but it pays great
That is, until you lose appeal
And your release date gets date raped
Stay safe, hold your head
I got two fish and a loaf of bread
Feed the people, food for thought
Cause we are equal, who'd have thought

[Hook: Ab-Soul] (Kendrick)
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
(You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light)
(You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light)

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I used to wanna rap like Jay Z, now I feel I could run laps 'round Jay Z
Nas ain't seen nothing this nasty, Big and Pac got it coming when I pass too
You got the mic? I ain't the one you wanna pass to
My niggas say my new shit past due
I paid dues, even got that shit tattooed, HiiiPower on another plateau
I know you know we need a few plaques too
The brand new niggas with a attitude
Popping Compton or Timbuktu
I might even sell my new shit for 10 bucks too
Too ill when I jot these words, true eel when I shock the world
I know life's a bitch, when you know life's a bitch and that's not your girl
Cold shit, I'm hot though, like coal get, Ab-Soul
This is a shift in paradigm, I remember when I couldn't spare a dime
Now I step in with a pair of dimes, on P's, y'all know me
Flow like water, admiralty, the best author ever to breathe
And as we proceed to follow these dreams, I ain't losing no sleep
No, no on them NoDoz, just know "No" if it's no dough
So high but I'm Soulo, two cups and I sip slow, taking my time
We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show, now let's go

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Time and time I drop line for line, but only time will tell
If I ever go Columbine and cop 30 nines and cock back and kill
See the truth is, they wanna know how close me Dre and Snoop is
Or how the shoe fits when they choose this to beat 2Pac but truth I give
Two shits 'bout expectations or critics hating, shit, I just put moms on vacation
Bitch you never know my new location, it's across nations
Court cases get thrown out, so tell the mothafuckin' King dethrone now
I am ruler, I am highness, the Prince Zamunda, I am the shit like what the prune does
Black on black tint like Kinta Kunta, black is back bitch, I'm kin to coup de
Black on black crime resent the shooter, blat-blat-blat, I intend to mute you
Racks on racks, I don't rap on tracks without my A-game so please don't ask
Me about no pressure, bitch with the grip of my fingertip, I can hold this coast together

[Hook]
