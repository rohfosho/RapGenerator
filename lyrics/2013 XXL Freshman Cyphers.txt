These niggas don't beez in the trap, they like bees in this track

Just smoked out, I ain't talking 'bout what you toke out

Get choked out fo'rilly, thinking that this shit a silly dream

When actually reality ain't what it really seem

And I ain't acting on the scene niggas scream

The actions ain't screened, just well schemed

I'm trying to have wealth for my well being by 18

Pockets healthy green, what the fuck is 12 beans?

I need the cake and cream, stakes is high like fiends off a dream

Jet streaming having cuisine with the best seasons

It's the vet season carry a vest you know the reason

I'm in Chiraq and I'm getting blown like the breezes

Your chicken strip tease us, thighs leg and the breast part is the cleavage

She even lick it down to the bone marrow

She in love but I don't got a bow and arrow

I'm known to jack the booty like I'm sparrow

They ain't trying to see me in the battle, they lines is too narrow

They couldn't even outshine my shadow

They don't want the beef nigga let alone the cattle

They just want to ride the saddle, it's so sad though



Hammers present, you gettin' wrapped up

Uhh, jump out the Mack truck, black tux

Go 'head and act up, drink the blood out of the brass cup

Your jewels are fake those are glass cut

No snakes keep the grass cut

Thick dominican women skin cinnamon with they ass up

Sick spinning, I stay shitting like a sick pigeon

Different colors glisten of the wrist prism

Blicker off the hip hit 'em, spun 'em

Chopped an onion, in the process peeped the diagnostics

See my shorty draped up in an ostrich

Smoking weed from the doctor

As I sit on a train to Paris draped in fabric like an arabic

Mommy always knew her boy was talented

Come off tour give her 20 thou for nothing

Cause it's nothing to me I'm something to see

Sunk in the sea, Duncans on feet

Shits are shiny take a shower rather dump in the heat

Jump out the jeep looking fly like a bundle of geese, jeez

I'm on some shit

I'm talking 7 series triplets, bitches with military fitness

And my girl a shooter like Chamique Holdsclaw

With coke in the door, she used to play ball

For Christ the King, selling drugs got her the icy ring though

Me



The last black hippy to get a wiki

I'm in your city getting a hickey from your chick in her Vickies

Don't try act like I ain't popping homie

My style like Mandela meets Monster Kody

Cop backwoods by the box bro, OG only

Drop 460 for a zip, need 2 to be cozy

I hate to stunt but look me up

Evil Knievel ain't much when I do my stuff

Polo tee polo black cologne

Burberry by my nuts she won't leave me lone

The Levi's was on sale, but I ain't flexing hard

Flexing, never had a 24 Hour Fitness card

I told myself I wouldn't flip I made a little bit

I'm no magician but I hope this blue dolphin do the trick

Behind the mic with a thizz face

You take your Mrs. through my entrance thats a mistake

I got it bad like Usher Raymond

Middle finger to the plaintiff, screaming Top Dawg Entertainment

Look I don't know why you niggas hating

I take that back cause I know why you niggas hating

I just said it cause I likeded how it came in

I even used likeded, that ain't a word, I'm just saying

I got to be the greatest on this land, I spell high with

3 I's and I'll never never land

The rap Mike Jack, Peter Pan with 28 grams

Hendrix with no guitar, Albert on Adderall

Yeah, jug

Smoke 'til I'm Weezy don't worry what's in my cup



Speeding, and damn I’m leaning, on the Kawasaki

In the lobby, got me dro codinein’, out in Abu Dabi

Chain beaming, hope it ain't anemic, cause you might feel drowsy

Out in Sweden, just me and four women, and we all playing hockey

Blow Scott La Flame, pimpin, no cane

Rocking the chain and hood with no pass

Fucked up the flow, nothing but fam cause niggas be hoes

Have that, pass that, light it up and then blow

Imagery abstract, it's like NASDAQ when I stock it up and then grow

Packed it up and moved to Goldman Sachs, my nigga Yeezy done taught me that

Young niggas in the Soho House spilling booze wherever the Barbies at

Damn homie, this a movie nigga, take a picture or somethin', where your Kodak at?

Scottie is tokin and swimming with women, he writing, producing, then score and filming it

Oh god, my god, this shit be like God-level

Nigga you talking money nigga, stacking several

Bonds over billions niggas the real is in the building

With Ye and Hova niggas know what the deal is

The deal is nigga the realest

Young Scott the rock, rocking from the Phyllis

Got my nigga Bronson, Joey, Ab-Soul

And you know a nigga pockets getting swole on the road, yup
