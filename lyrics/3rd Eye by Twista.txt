See you with the eye

Rather at the apex of a pyramid or the forehead of a cyclops

Talking shit to me make sure you're off the right block

Still I'mma come through in the Mercedes Benz white drop

Might stop, but only if I know you I don't mean to blow you with the statement

But I don't be fuckin' with these niggas, and that's why they be hatin'

Cause I stay in the zone, I be alone, so excuse me if I'm wrong

I'm off a kush, and when the T.H.C. affect the dialect I be as free as the wind and fire

Let the energy in me be my empire yet the remedy for me is ultraviolet, violence, silence

All the critic's when I spit it I'mma creature of punishment when it comes to torturing

And with this rap shit I'm a beast

Balling like I'm Uncle Pauly and all of the above we goin' in the club incognito with the snub

East, be the direction that I'm prayin in

But I'm a Midwest nigga

Mean with a verse, something fly- I am seen with it first

So they can say "Where you get that nigga?"

The essence of my vocabulary's exquisite when I enter into a realm, taking me to the helm

Of lyricism, you gonna be callin' me majesty, callin' a tragedy that you gotta see on film

So I salute and advise you not to shoot, you are not equivalent or parallel to my level

Sub-par, So coming at me wrong is worse then being on the carousel with the devil

I can turn these happy homes and these fake MC's into whole apartment buildings and vacancies

Bakeries, cook em til they done, whoop em til they wump, put a funk in them niggas

Watch what you say to me



Don't play with me, I'mma make a hater pray to me

God cause I'm hard and my flows is the coldest

You are no threat, don't step, I am a descendent of Imhotep, yes, Moses knows this

Of annihilation we are on a brink, I be smokin' up the stink, so before somebody thinks

See see i'mma start to get ugly as Michael Spinks  , when I rap about the Sphinx, instead of about minks

Knowledge is power so he taught you 'bout your third eye



Type of shit I make a bird swim, fish fly

Fuck it, touch the sky on the first try

Man a motherfucker could never control me, only squeeze me and hold me

Is what the ho came up and told me, Now is she bold g?

But in my mouth is where the gold be, cause I be playin' her like Goldy

Ab-Soul I know ya know me

Pack of Backwoods jar of that good yeah I blow it by the OZ

I never sleep, you getting cozy

I made it out the jungle, I should write a book about Mowgli

I ain't a killer but don't push me

I hit you with a Sig, but I'd rather smoke up on a stogie

God MC, you could say I'm holy

The ghost of Alori Joh walk with me so a nigga never lonely

Solo (Soulo), but Top Dawg is a army

Flow AT and T nigga 4 g's

Might be the hip hop Bob Marley, Taking shots at politicians while I roll weed

Easily Eazy-E without the Jheri Curl Juice

Off that drank that make you think every girl cute

On top of the pyramid, A angles acute

Mark of the Beast on me, him, her, and you

Money in the safe in case there's a lawsuit

Because any lumberjack would say they saw you

Me and Twista in the cut twistin up a blunt what the fuck you want?
