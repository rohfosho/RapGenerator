[Hook]
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

[Verse 1]
Man, I swear, my nigga trippin' off that shit again, pick him up
Then I set him in cold water, then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
Hope to take the pain away from the feelin' that he feel today
You know, when you part of Section.80, you feel like no one can relate
Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin' off my generation, sippin' cough syrup
Like it's water, never no pancakes in the kitchen, man
No wonder our lives is caught up in the daily superstition
That the world is 'bout to end, who gives a fuck? We never do listen
'Less it comes with an 808 (A melody and some hoes)
Playstation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)
Lookin' around and all I see is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream, yep
Her president is black, she black too
Purple Label on her back, but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head
Then she look at me, she got A.D.H.D

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Like whoa, ooh whoa, whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Like whoa, ooh whoa, whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Like whoa, ooh whoa, whoa
(They always told me A.D.H.D did it)

[Verse 2]
And then she started...
And then she started feelin' herself like no one else in this apartment
Beg your pardon, oh I rap baby, how old are you?
She say 22, I say 23 "Okay, then we all crack babies"
Damn, why you say that? She said, "Where my drink at?
I'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors have the police relax"
I stood up, shut the blinds, closed the screen; jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside, then she said, read between the lines
Yep hope that I get close enough, when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up, when the Nuvo start to drown
Her body and I know the both of us really deep in the move now
It's nothin' we can do now, somebody walked in with a pound
Of that Bay Area kush, she looked at me then looked
At it, then she grabbed it, then she said, "get it understood
You know why we crack babies
Because we born in the '80s, that A.D.H.D crazy"

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
Double cup, deuce, four, six, just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, shrooms, blow, 'dro, hoes, whatever you like
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light[Produced by Sounwave]
