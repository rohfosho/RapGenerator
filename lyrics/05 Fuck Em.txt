Niggas gotta make it, I'm serious, niggas gonna make it, seriously. You hear me, I come from that straight under shit. They really fucking with me, ya feel me?
I only live one time, I'm trying to keep my head right
Niggas doing fed time, that's similar to me
I be going hard, so I'm facing like 55
Niggas don't want that, I be selling dope sacks
Niggas want me dead cos I'm still in the states
I be at Fort Knox; nigga, I am a cop
Ride with intel on ya, my life full of pain
Niggas don't understand, niggas don't even care
Man, I'm just on my dick, niggas didn't give me cash
How I'm gonna move? (Stick up that) Don't know how I'm gonna move (where that nigga at? Where he at?)
Come with that chopper, then I'm gonna act a fool
My niggas wanted trophies, but I wanted cases
Niggas heard my rap, then they said I'm going places
Kept me off the street, all them boys living dead
Niggas eating fast food, niggas serving fast dope
Niggas catching hot bullets, you ain't going to war
Niggas lost the streets, niggas want to keep the peace
Niggas act out of pocket, niggas get dealt with
Straight top shelf shit, make a nigga melt quick
Ain't no rumors, them boys on repeat
All the shit that I did, some days I couldn't
I couldn't go to sleep
Traumatized, chasing me down
They had that shit, but I still live
Don't respect me, niggas ain't checked me
I had real beef and I didn't let it stress me
Real 05, I'm really 05
Fuckers hate, I was based in 05
2013, niggas mad I'm still grinding
I'm still alive and they hate that
Niggas gonna hate that, I paint the Maybach
You feel me, and I'm not from the hood, what?
That's okay, but them choppers gonna spray
How you a vet if you ain't in the Oak?
Say you a dope dealer but you got a Purple Heart
Robbed them meth labs and I burnt them bitches
Never crossed real niggas, I've burnt no bridges
