(Malcolm X)

And once we see that all these other sources to which we’ve turned have failed, we stop turning to them and turn to ourselves

Once you change your philosophy, you change your thought pattern. Once you change your thought pattern, you change your attitude. Once you change your attitude, it changes your behavior pattern



(Verse 1: Vic mensa)

This is a higher level of thought

I let the mind work and the song play the long way

To show the true meaning of the heart

Yeah, take it back to start

In 6th grade, when I was stealing

And never thinking of getting caught

Then I came up, got a little game up

Used to leave up out the playground and go flame up

Writing graffiti tryin' to get a nigga name up

The paint used to bubble on the glass

Like pourin' champagne up

Started out fast, no change up

I Rememberin when you hear a girl parents on the phone and you hang up

Man the first time I got arrested I was 13

Stealin blunts from the store blowin dirt green

Paint on my clothes, I couldn't keep a shirt clean

Never been a bench player, always on the first team

And PHLI put me on that fresh shit in '06

When I used to call shoes in the store, "kicks."

The part of memory ??? miss

Cause ain't nobody see it like a youtube video with no hits

I spit crack, keep the fiends with a flow fix

Ya girl is bomb my nigga, she blow dicks

I'm trappin', and I ain't never sold no bricks

Grindin' in the same pair of jeans till the hole rips

I thought I made when I started buying whole zips

And now my niggas are blowing O's like smoke tricks

Listening to Wiz, higher then a flight school

I keep a 4 point, and I'on even like school

I'm hotboxin' with the tint to let the light through

I lot of niggas be trippin about the shit I might do

I'm like a wrinkle in time

I would rather make a classic

Than drop a fuckin single and sign

Let them other niggas mingle in line, twinkle and shine

A star ??? 99 brinkle to grind

It's cold wine when I drink and I dine

Got problems, but I'm like bougie bitches

I be thinkin I'm fine

Now hol' up

Who do you go to, when you the one to go to?

And ya'll don't the shit they be sayin' like goku

Look, you know the bars get dumber every other summer

I'm like izzy nigga, finger, snap, bummer

Greg, what up? I'm the rapper he the drummer

You the lame and ya girl do the pipe, she the plumber

I'm zoned out, flyin in a another dimension

Another day, another detention

Smokin with eddie and em

Gramps bout to puff on his pension

And I just fuckin suspension

So I'm back where i started at

Cardiac, flow get a heart attack

The snapback cap was dead 'fore I brought it back

Nigga you could call me mister starter cap

You be on that sucka shit cuffin

Her pop said he want his daughter back

You the wrong side of the track

You like an artifact

And I was probably sittin in class when I thought of that

It's a couple of different ways you make of it

And I'm chillin with....



(Saul Williams)

Now is the essence of my domain

And it contains all that it was and will be

And I am as I always and will be

Cause I am and always will be that nigga

I am that nigga. I am that nigga

I am that nigga
