[Intro: DJ Khaled]
This is for the hood, this is for the ghetto
This is for the niggas getting that money
That cash money, that 100 million dollar money
We got money
We the best

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Ridin' big, gettin' mine
Two microwaves flip a brick at a time
Bandanna on the handle ready for the whip
When I wear the whitest soft watch it disappear
I disappear in the middle of the night
When I reappear, bet the boss look so bright
For life, dough boy
More strikes, oh boy
We ridin' low, gettin' high
80 round drum let ya know the time
When you see the Maybach, niggas know it's mine
Ridin' on the 2-4's I'm ahead of my time
Watch runnin' from kind, another one on my mind
Phone bill 4 grand get your ho on my line
In the hood, ho niggas act funny
Only real niggas really get to touch cash money

[Hook: Dre]
I spent 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars
And I came from the ghetto (ghetto), and I came from the ghetto (ghetto)
If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up, If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up
If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up, If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up
If ya ghetto

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Everyday a new whip homie, So you know I gets my shine on
Flip after we flip homie, So you know I gets my grind on
Birdman daddy, Pullin up in the brand new Cadi
Got money, living lavish, Got bitches, shipping package
Move them things, Get them things, Switch that lane
Get that chain, Flip them thangs, Get yo money hommie do your thing
See I got em like 10 times, spend money got em like 10 times
Flip that got em like 10 times, Got money like 10 more times nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
I'm from the ghetto, the bottom, the hood, the slums
There's money out here, we just trying to get some
Cool like Dre nigga, A like K
When ya talk about me you better watch what ya say
Don't ever keep them things where ya lay
Cuz them pussy ass niggas show the folks where ya stay
Ya thought he was ya dog, said he was a G
Sounds like another co-defendant to me
Niggas move sloppy and I really don't like it
Fuck around and get everybody indicted
Saw this shit coming, you woulda thought I was a psychic
Fuck around go dead broke trying to fight it

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
I, I, I all night it, I every day it
And when it comes to my dues, I over payed it
Rated hood bitch, Bitch I'm hood bitch
I ain't a asshole, but I'm on some hood shit
I wish I would switch, I don't know how
Blood gang swarm like a red ant pile
Mean mug, like I can't smile
Like my grill didn't, Cost me a 100 thou

I smell a lot of 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars
And I came from the ghetto (ghetto), and I came from the ghetto (ghetto)
If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up, If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up
If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up, If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up
If ya ghetto

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
Cash Money Millionaires, Cash Money Billionaires, Cash Money Trillionaires
We rich
We ain't never gone stop, never
We got money nigga
