[Hook: Quavo]
Most of these bitches ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mine
Stop claimin' me bitch, you know you lyin'
Most of these bitches ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mine
You can have that little bitty bitch, you know she ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mine

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Most of these bitches they ain't mine, nigga
You can have that bitch, I swear she ain't no dime, nigga
She no quarter, I won't spoil her
Think she Moses when she cross the water
Immigrant, she cross the border
How the fuck niggas say they can afford my bitches?
It's the same niggas rockin' Jordans
Pull up Trailblazer, like I'm in Portland
White boy shoot better than Kyle Korver
300 Spartans, my niggas immortal
Sellin' fishes, I got Nemo and Dory
In the swamp with gators like I'm in Florida
Tryna get rich like Richard Porter
Takin' that Pyrex pot and glass bowl
And stickin' my hand in that water
If the bitch try to take a quarter
It gon' be a homicide, Law and Order
It's cheaper to leave her
But it's gon' cost you some money if you wanna spoil her
She got that Aquafina, call her water
She wanna ride on top of my Sequoia

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Offset]
You cuffin' your ho and I'm fuckin' your ho
Like a light, she can switch
Sloppy toppy, eat it, licorice
Wipe the gloss off your lip when you suck the dick
Why you claimin' a nigga? You know you ain't mine
It's time to cut her off, it's 'bout that time
Why the fuck you keep lyin'? You a little fine
I'm not wastin' my time, only spend with dimes
She got the audacity say that we're married
Chasin' a nigga like Tom & Jerry
Look how she standin', she Halle Berry
I laugh at the bitch like I'm Tyler Perry
Your birthday, be singin' like Mary Mary
She say she a virgin, don't got a cherry
I'm not fuckin' no bitch if the pussy hairy
I'm passin' your bitch like a Hail Mary
She wanna claim me cause I'm famous
Mexico groupie bitches, they be dangerous
Immigrant bitches, they don't speak our language
I don't fight over bitches, I leave your shirt painted
Innocent bitches, they look like a model
Shaped like a bottle, they suck and they swallow
Lil' mama, she bad so niggas gon' holla
And shouts out lil' mama, she only fuck ballers

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Quavo]
You can have, she ain't mine
No, I don't want her
I don't want her
Yes she's foreign, I caught her in Barcelona
Got this Spanish lil' mama, like to drink Corona
But you can have her, she gon' instantly bend it over
Cuffin' bitches, I ain't worried 'bout it
Cause everybody know about it
I pulled up to my mansion in the Audi
Smashed and then she outtie
Say she from New York, I had to call my nigga Rosh
He told me that she goin' in, she got that sloppy toppy
So you know what I did?
I got her suckin' me up in a Benz
She told me she wanted a threesome
I told that lil' bitch call her friend
When I pull, light the light, the Forgis slide
You must be blind if this money you think ain't mine
