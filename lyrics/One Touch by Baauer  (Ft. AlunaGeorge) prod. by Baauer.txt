I will make you a sunset view

I will make it so you're gonna want to

Get your hands involved with me

I don't ever wanna be empty



I just popped a Senzu bean

I said I just popped a Senzu bean

Mama where I leave my memory?

Probably the same place I left my ID (hey)

Y-3's, gave a young nigga wings

I sneeze, gave a young nigga steeze

Five G's, fall like leaves

In the spring Imma run it like police, we be clubbing

1800's, bubbling a nigga's stomach

Three girls, so that mean I'm in here juggling

She might have a man, I might have a girl

But neither one of 'em at the club so who give a fuck

Arrived on the scene with some booty shakin' hoes

And they not the twerk team

All these hoes got their hands on they knees

I said all these hoes got their hands on they knees





Goin' clubbin'

I beat the pussy up left the girl on crutches

I'm goin' clubbin'

You know that I'm bout to gonna slice up the dutchies

I'm goin' clubbin'

Tell me when she ready just hit me on my phone

Goin' clubbin'

If you got some foo' friends bitch don't come along

Let me make a scene

Ooh if you bad I might just put you in the ring

Ooh if you bad I might just buy you that machine

Ooh if you bad I might just dress you so clean

Woah, how you wear your hair

Make a nigga want to buy you this

Take you down to Paris and ice out your wrist

Chew you like a nigga did when he was a six

I make it look easy





All I really need is one touch, I want you to put it right here all night

All I need is one touch, I want you to put it right here

All I really need is one touch, I want you to put it right here all night

All I need is one touch, I want you to put it right here

You're gonna make me drag your ass over here

I don't mind, cause I've got no fear

In your eyes, it's written clear (it's written clear)

You're gonna make me, drop my Glock to the floor

I don't mind, but I need some more

So be kind and make me sure (make me sure)

I will make you a sunset view

I will make it so you're gonna want to

Get your hands involved with me

I don't ever wanna be empty

All I really need is one touch, I want you to put it right here on me

All I need is one touch, I want you to put it right here
