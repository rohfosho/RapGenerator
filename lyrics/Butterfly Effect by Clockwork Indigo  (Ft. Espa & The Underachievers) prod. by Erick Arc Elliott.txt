Before the tours have filled the calendar

I was in Brooklyn, smokin' Cali bud

And I accepted rap, eyes red from that

5 AM flights, eyes red from that

Mr. wouldn't cop the white one if it came in black

Frequent 30 cities while you're witnessin' my chicken scratch

Type of shallow nigga, fuck and give your lady back

Constructed in the lab, Flatbush where they raised me at

Now I lost some friends, but fuck it we don't need 'em

We barely friends before and we don't talk for different reasons

Mom's all sad, pops gon' snap

Make some difference in this world before your mind goes black

How can a nigga do his homework when his mom's on crack?

How can I produce a record that be equal to that?

Every time I play some new shit, I'm just thinking it's whack

My motivation for the youth is how we bringin' it back



Bringin' it back, bringin' it back (here we go again)

Been waitin' so long it’s like they use to that crap

Hip Hop been my life, I'm just used to the facts

Sellin' dope not an option, ain't new to the trap

Faggot niggas wanted the fame, they used to the back

My niggas boardin' a plane, Insta vid that

I'm confident as ever, my tolerance is low

For hatin' mothafucker's doubtin' me like I ain't dope

Crack, say the word chap, I leave a skull cap

Morbid with the four fifth and the boss pit

Torture, hot, burn it, like a perm quick

My melodies is heaven sent, y'all ain't heard shit



Old days, back before the rappin' and my aura swankin'

Youthful savage, used to dream of passion, now we make it happen

Spittin' average 'til my kin descended upon this planet

Rare to see, Sirius Star B, I'ma Star Seed

My light-beam across the nation, changin' tastes, unitin' races

Higher placement, laugh at basic, 90 angel, tempt to Satan

Blend it up, equal greatness, rock the podium with my statements

I'm the thirteenth king raised up out the monarchy

Palm trees, roll it up, dedicate it to my sovereignty

Fuck this separation shit is tasters, we one entity

Like a bunch of shit stirred in the pot but still one recipe

Indigo the leaders, puttin' the youth through trainin', nigga

Never thought we would make it, now we unpluggin' it from the matrix

Spit iconic, Issa Gold, the proper way, the youthful conscious

Truth won't stop us, my light stream shinin', blockin' out they nonsense



Brooklyn born and raised, some say we free, some say we caged

But they hold the key to change they ways

But mind be sleep, they mental slate

You not in my league, I see through the great

Cut the pot then I leap through the asses and came

I go crying in the corner with immaculate brains

Hold up, I'm beast and I cannot be tamed

Remember when we were starvin', dreams was tarnished

Hoping one day we'd be ballin', ain't that all us?

Now we done it, use your brain and never forfeit

Now I talk how I'm livin' with conscious

Good intentions, flawless karma

And this mission keeps us stronger

Fight for the day we be peaceful and honest



I would die for every single nigga on this track, hol' up

It's only right that we bring it back

I done died for every single nigga on this track, hol' up

It's only uh- that we bring it uh-uh



I'm destined for damnation, need to let out frustration

So I threw a Molotov at the nearest police station

Tell the reaper that I'm waitin', shit, Hell would be a vacation

At least I won't need a lighter to spark up them Cali flavors

The point is to read the book and burn the chapters after

Why are we moving backwards? Mentally we still in shackles

Our life, it like sand castles, we are not built to last

But if we pack together close enough, the weather, we would stand

One day, I'll have a queen and she won't need no weddin' band

The weight of the world I benchpress, no flexin' for the Gram

The man that travels many lands withstands and you can't understand

Your standards, I am over them, feel like I am petroleum

The chosen one, my tongue's a sword for ya, I brought my loaded gun

I got this ongoin' battle with this shit, de-pression

The pressure is buildin' up but fuck it I ain't givin' up

And even if I did, so what?



Time we waste, in this waiting game

So butterfly away, come visit heaven's gates
