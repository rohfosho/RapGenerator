Uh, right



I'm a loco, nigga, straight loco

So think twice 'fore you cross my path

Cause frontin' on DZA's a no go

I said a no go, told y'all, niggas is a Bozo

To go against my word just take it from me cause I know so

Nigga no thought

Bodied in the trap, you get roped off

Call me Polo Young

Nigga this a mothafuckin' Lo Sport

Kick that shit like none other

Rearrange a deal, need more mugga

Tryna get drunk as a fish tonight

Holla at my homeboy Joe Scudda

Straight shots, I don't need no ice in it

Got me talking reckless all night with it

All these old niggas on Gotti dick

Real life, he ain't even like niggas

Tryna be more like Bob Lemon

Obsession with the flow let the beat ride

From the West to the East side

Light the sour and bump this joint up in your G ride



Uh, I'm sittin' high, I'm tippin' slow

I'm gettin' high, but I'm sippin' slow

Mouth full of golds, nigga I got hella hoes

I'm that Harlem mothafucka with that mellow flow

Coming down, sittin' clean, mixin' that Promethazine



(Purple, we loco! Purple, we loco!

On purple, we loco! Purple, we loco!)



I'm a corporal

Been around the globe, you're a local

Niggas know ya gaffe and we laugh at the ash

That ya pass cause you’re more like Fogel

I thought I told you

You niggas hard of hearin', thought I told you

There's some new niggas eating in the hood

Shit. them other niggas old news

We them new niggas

Clappin at strong, whole crew's stable

Me and my niggas run this shit

Coolest niggas sittin' at the cool table

Niggas pop shit on the web

Hide up in they crib cause they ain't able

'til you GPS a nigga's crib, tell some niggas where they live

Like they worked for cable, but they bout that life

You niggas ain’t with it though

You know, who you fooling?

You know you don’t smoke for real

Why you tryna reach for the doob? What you doing?

'til the next life

It's Jet Life, flying high is luxury

Ain’t shit changed, still George Kush

Still need eight lungs to come puff with me
