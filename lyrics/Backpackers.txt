Alright it's Childish baby, Mr. Talk About His Dick Again
Nerdy-ass black kid, whatever man I'm sick of him
That well-spoken token, who ain't been heard
The only white rapper who's allowed to say the N-word
I buy a bunch of 'em and put it on my black card
Now I got some street cred, use it 'til it's maxed out
I got a girl on my arm, dude, show respect
Something crazy and Asian, Virginia Tech
She too fine, I do dimes
If not that, I'm walking out with two fives
Change my ID for the cops, it's not enough yet
Black male in short shorts, I'm double suspect
Ballin' since '83, half of 'em say he gay
Maybe that's the reason I like Lady What-babies-say
I'm a problem, I'm lame as fuck homie
But I rap like these niggas ain't got shit on me
Fuck the cool kids, not Chuck Inglish
But people who think that hatin on me makes them distinguished
Like, "What is this nigga doin? Rap is for real blacks
I hate that fucking faggot, man, he think that we feel that"
Or "I wrote on rape culture my junior year at Brown
So I'm allowed to say what all his raps are about"
You better shut your mouth before I fuck it
You really hate my lyrics now or Kid Cudi's? Nigga
Runnin this thang, money insane
Busy getting brain like Krang
What, what's my name? In the woods, got these niggas usin' Mapquest
Man, fuck a backpacker
Niggas with OCD, N-W-O
All white like my clothes, CW shows
Nigga got signed, it's an anomaly
No cosign: trigonometry
Man these niggas hate me
"Man, fuck you nigga...fuck you nigga!"
They real black like won't show up on your camera phone
They real black like turn the flash on your camera on
They real black take shit, turn it into gold
I'm real black I survive when the pressure on
Upper echelon, bit my lip when I'm kissin' her
Clash of the Titans, baby your tits is titular
Listenin to some Kiss FM, she wanna hear Nicki Minaj
"Super Bass," super face inside a garage
It's not a massage, spa rap with a happy ending
Old niggas wanna assassinate me
It's a shame, these kids was supposed to save rap
Fuck that, boat shoes and a wave cap
He don't give back, how the fuck a nigga say that?
Summer in November I gave everyone a Maybach
Comin' on that payback, comin' on that mace took
I'm comin' on that real shit, I'm comin' on her Facebook
Fuck a backpacker with a rhino's dick
I do me like a gyno chick, uh
