I'm the next 2Pac and Biggie

Scaled dope for 2Pac, pockets on Biggie

Pop a molly have you shaking like that nigga Diddy

Your pockets fat but now they slim, call it Missy



I got that Bobby Brown but I ran out of Whitney

Still got some Brittney, got a lot of Lindsey

Citgo on 48, come get this Julius Erving

Smoking Larry Kush and we call it Eddie Murphy

And I keep my circle tight, like a virgin

Black and grey old Cutlass, George Gervin

Fuck your mama make you made, call me Melvin

Drugged up I'm bout to overdose, call me Elvis

The world is mine I feel like Scarface

I'm fucking hoes I feel like Babyface

I know some migos put a scar on your face

That bitch bad she got a baby face

Her ass fat but she got a baby waist

That's my lil' boo thang, I call her Babycakes

Bout to go to the jeweler, call up TV Johnny

Want Takeoff to do a show? Gon' cost some TV money



I know junkies in the street selling DVDs

Mp3's, I know niggas who sell M-16s

Got a plug thats talking them bricks, dealing with Yao Ming

Got a plug on that gas, and that lean



I know junkies that will kill, for a bump

I know niggas that finesse pigeons out the trunk

Lil' goons on the block like a 9 to 5

I know J's that cut your grass just for a dime

I know hoes that sell they soul for bankroll

Same bitch in high school, she act like I don't know her

Birds flyin' in, just for the summer season

Coca so good, had the junkies nose bleeding

Junky clean my rims, rake my leaves, wash my car

Cause he know I got that pack take him off to Mars

I ask lil' mama have she ever rolling off them bars

She suck me up then call my phone askin' for them bars

Feds calling up my phone saying that I'm selling squares

Selling birds, selling pigeons, flying to Brazil

Feds calling up my phone saying that I'm selling squares

Selling birds, selling pigeons, flyin' to Brazil





Plug across the water, I'm taking a vacation

Plug helping me eat, Army salvation

Your bitch with me (What time it is?)...penetration

And I fucked her so good she hyperventilating

International J's some be Haitian some be Asian

Quarterback vision, you can call me Peyton

J's at the Texaco working like they slaving

Working with the  soda, its already baking

Fiends crave it, fiends itching like its poison ivy

Moving all these drugs, CVS should gon' and hire me

Shake and bake on a plug, call it Ricky Bobby

Sylvester Stallone on my wrist cause it rocky

Some fiends like the mollies, some fiend like the icies

Some fiend like the xans, white like Klu Klux Klan

My money be piling, my goons move silent

My goons be violent, finesse I'm outtie
