Caroline, Caroline

All the guys would say she's mighty fine

But mighty fine only got you somewhere half the time

And the other half either got you cursed out or coming up short

Yeah, now dig this, even though

You'd need a golden calculator to divide

The time it took to look inside and realize

That real guys go for real down to Mars girls, yeah



I know you'd like to thank your shit don't stank

But lean a little bit closer, see that roses really smell like poo-poo-oo

Yeah, roses really smell like poo-poo-oo



Caroline, see she's the reason for the word bitch

I hope she's speeding on the way to the club

Tryna hurry up to get to some baller or singer or somebody like that

And try to put on her make up in the mirror and crash, crash, crash

Into a ditch, just playing

She needs a golden calculator to divide

The time it took to look inside and realize

That real guys go for real down to Mars girls, yeah





Well, she's got a hottie's body but her attitude is potty

When I met her at a party, she was hardly acting naughty

I said "Shorty, would you call me?" She said, "Pardon me, are you balling?"

I said "Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing"

Oh, so you're one them freaks

Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt

But game been peeped, dropping names she's weak

Tricking off this bitch is lost, must take me for a geek

A quick way to eat, a neat place sleep

A rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat

No go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless

Regardless, we don't want to get involved with all them lawyers

And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom

I wanna see your support bra, not support you





Better come back down to Mars

Girl, quit chasing cars

What happens when the dough gets low

Bitch, you ain't that fine, no way, no way, no way



Crazy bitch

(Bitch, stupid ass bitch, old punk-ass bitch

Old dumb-ass bitch, a bitch's bitch, just a bitch)
