Cocaine sticking to the pyrex
(Lito, no I ain’t sipping on no hot tea)
Sale on the line tryna' buy that
What you mean we ain’t got lean, we supply that nigga
Vinegar on the dog food, try that nigga'
The recompress sticking to the side
Women on the line tryna feel it in they spine
Mob something, let my nigga Gunna kill it from behind
Hold up
Rule number one, look it ain’t no rules
Rule number two, can’t, don't lose
If the dope don’t come back what you gon do
When the nigga ain’t answering that mean you got wooed
Finesse, stress, happen to the best
Fuck the rest told Gates I don’t get tired neither
I ain't lying, on the grind all the time, life on the line
Lose my mind fore I forget my heater
Trapback gang in my section, Ferrari out the exit
Washington, I’m fly
Nigga try to whip me, brrrra
Jump back on the interstate, I’m headed to the nine
Menace hit me, say he need another nine
Nina drop me off in the Calio with Bub
Say Kiera waiting on him with the candles by the tub
If she try to set him up, then her parents getting drugged
Out in bucket, with my nigga boss ten up the country
Shooters in the den, rubber band up the money
You know Mazi out his money, get her signed then we coming
Bitch ass nigga, man what’s wrong with em
Most don’t believe in god, I’m the wrong nigga
AK47 with the chrome in it
This a swing back stock, think I won’t send it?
100 round drum, yeah I’m long winded
My nigga chasing commas got a long sentence
Old bitch, he know that I don’t get along with her
The money long gone, so she don’t visit
Me, myself, and I, them my co-defendants
Back to Tennessee with Arizona midget
Lower ticket, bank roll, hundred gang
The bails in twentys
I need every penny, got my scale and an extended
Chopper got a stand, half a man, that’s a midget
Lito get the C note that they ran with the digit
Ask can I take a piss, sprayed the blam, that’s a semi
