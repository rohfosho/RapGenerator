I have sunlight on me like earth

I'm tryin' to get clean, wash away the dirt

I want to hold you so bad right now

I bought a pack of the eggplant loud

If you go up against me, you'll go down

If you go up against me, you'll go down

Inside the shadows, they come out at night

All that I want is to enter the light

After I die, I wake up and I rise

T-shirt is black and XL size



Six cell phones but no one to go to

Bladeecity, I wonder where are you

Face stays clean but my conscience is dirty

Mercedes, had to put it on thirty

Bladeecity, I had to put it on thirty

Face stays clean but my conscience is dirty

Mercedes, had to put it on thirty

Bladeecity, I had to put it on thirty



Won't see a smile on my face

I'm so sad, I'm so icy, bang-bang to your face

I pity the world before I go to my dreams

I sleep when I don't need, I'm in a fantasy street

I'll be schemin' and leanin', ya'll try to be seen

But when I'm all alone, I'm real sad in the evening

Counting money like a preacher, champagne fries in my freezer

I sip Arizona by the liter, you don't like you much, me neither

Sushi lunch before I meet her, I bring lobster down if I see her

I look down when I meet her
