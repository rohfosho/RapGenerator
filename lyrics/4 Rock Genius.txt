My heart beats fast 2 crash she runs ill thru my mind
Am I insane or not
Last time I checked, you payed no mind my dear
U each your own
Spiders in my bed tied up in
Your web eat heart out
Turn my flesh bone
Tear my skin away
Left me open, I was hidin u would
Leave me battered long as I [lose Thursday bet?]
Would you look at this
I'm on the blind side
Once again
I can't see thru darken lens
Dark of the night always so bright
I shade my eyes from shady friends

Along Alone
