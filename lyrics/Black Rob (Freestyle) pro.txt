And my bars hit harder than car collisions

My hands still hurt from all that pitchin

I'm still bitching for your dough, like Robin Givens

The Lebron of ours, so I was built for balling

You lazy ass niggas y'all was built for stalling

I'm still standing tall you can't knock me down

I ain't got a lot of weight but I'm packing pounds, get it?

(My name's Jay Rock I'm the man in the streets

If you need that work come holla at me)

Give me some green and give me some white

It's hard times so a nigga might double the price

I'm starving, got damn pockets to feed

On the mic spitting flows 800 degrees

I'm a hustler, nigga, yes I love the grind

Call me Busta, nigga, yes I love to rhyme

Yeah my hand never shaking when I'm holding a nine

Clutch game crazy, like Bird in his prime, nigga

(In these streets gotta carry your clips

If not your a dead ass son of a bitch)

I'm holding more K's than the Ku Klux Klan

You want a head up, you don't wanna see my hands, nigga

Got a jab like Judah that's no lie

Let four fly, all black blowflies

I'm from the projects don't get it twisted

Talking sideways you gon come up missing

Laid back in the truck, rolling up a Swisher

Dot in the back, tea bagged me a sister

(Yeah I'm from Watts and I rep the bricks

If you run your lip, we gon bust your shit)

You could catch Jay Rock on some gangsta shit

Rifles, plenty rounds got box of clips

I'm like pills in the club, I'll pop ya quick

Yeah that rhyme so sick I spit toxic shit

Yeah that flow so golden like a bottle of piss

(It's T-O-P D-A-W-G

It's the new West Coast and we run these streets)

There's no more drive-bys niggas do walk-ups

Spark stuff, leavin' bodies all chopped up

I got nines and a couple of Macs

That'll split a couple of heads and push shit back

I'm from the land where they push that crack

On Compton Ave., all the hoes yeah they sell that ash

You got money go and show your stash

But don't show your ass

Cause these killers they'll show no blast, nigga
