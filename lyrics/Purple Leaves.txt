(Marijuana legalization)
Yo
Mom's pissed as she said she's sick of me piffin'
She said whoever sold it to me must've been slippin'
So I told her that's the way they make a living
Mellowing them out and medicating the children
Don't knock it 'til you try it
Can't puff it 'til you buy it, though
So I guess that's just how they got me to write a fly with dro
I got zoot and now I'm sailing in the highest boat
Bowl full of green stuff
Looking like an Irish grove (swerve)
Or an Irish clove slashing where the violets drove
Drinking like a pirate so we crashing cause the pilot's throwed
(?) Sipping 4 Loko
Niggas paper thin, most thinking they hella coarse though
No pretty boy flows but still get more hoes
Smoking on that loud so you can hear the torso
Mom's scared I'll get caught and sent to court though
And end up where the crackheads shriek and squeal for more dope
"It's not the squid, Twist."
Fuck 'em on the welcome mat
Dipping out until senior year and then it's like "Welcome back"
To the place where people seldom acting they self please get out my face
She in lace
Plus we grow weed in outer space uh
With a space whip stray chicks stay whipped, masturbate slave tip
Flip tres and skate with no pavement, no flattop, no skate tricks
Stay linked up like Clifford and Satan
Homo-sapiens got nothing to say
Although the wave cray raping 'em
Flavor crossing seas radio frequencies
See sequence these ladies
And they always getting mad cause we treat they knees shady
Novia, niggas flirting, choke 'em out
Sipping syrup inside of my room and all my clothes are out
500 miles away the distance could be closer
If it wasn't one before, we're riding a roller coaster, now
I'm drinking Juicy Juice
Blowing out that fruity fruit
Different color hairs, bud looking like a rubix cube
When duty calls, usually duty's loose
Hollerin' at your girl then she holler back "hooty hoot"
Nu Age be the rudest group, circle small loopy loop
Hyper lisp misser like when hoochies hoo
Goofy goo boogers her coochie coo
Sugar so sweet
Plus I wifed her so you know I'm getting sugar for free
Picked up in a Nissan, unzipped the weed
She didn't need to ask because I know that she that she could hit with ease
And even though she whip it, she be gentle with the trees
Like that's just what it be's, like beez in the trap
Got a skeeze in that head-lock she's gonna snap
But she's looking pretty fly so she's receiving a dap
She make it clap like
Clap left, clap right
One clap like clap lights
The vision with purple leaves in the wrap, son
Nu Age, Kush Cartel, 18... yeah
