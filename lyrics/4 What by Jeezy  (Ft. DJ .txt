DJ Drama what it do my G?

It's the world nigga

We running the summer

I swear the night is starting to feel just like the night before

You know I'm on avion all acting a fool-io

We putting sparkles on them bottles make them move the ho



Step up in this bitch, you know I got my weapon

This ain't a gym class, why is everybody sweating

Yeah I send them hoes some bottles

Them bitches looking thirsty

My checks are for the rim

I'm in this bitch I'm looking birdy

You know the coupe is bloody murder

The coupe is bloody murder

Yeah that motherfucker black

Let's all pour color purple

34 squares so that 1200 a circle

Do them numbers in his head

Swear that nigga smart as Urkel

Mirror, mirror, should I kill them

Gourmet to the Tims

400 for this four door, and it ain't got no rims

Tell my waitress keep them bottles coming

I'm drinking like a fish

When those sparklers pass your table

All you bitches make a wish



How much liquor it gonna take to get it cracking in this bitch

Look I came to get it in now why you acting this bitch

Turn down for what? Turn down for what?

Just let me know give me the word I get it cracking in this ho

And I'm about to show out

You know it's packed up in this ho

Turn down for what? Turn down for what?



Motion picture shit, nigga I pull up in slo-mo

450 thou, I blew that on a two door

Shit I git a new , I'll send you to Pluto

Got a street nigga, but you knew that from the get-go

I'm turnt up to the max, and I'm just stunting on these niggas

I'm real as they say, so I'm holding court on these niggas

Wife beaters and jeans, and a pair of Jordans on these niggas

Head cocked to the back, and I smash the sport on these niggas

You get money then show it, if you ain't then stop lying

If you looking for a nigga, bitch I ain't hard to find

Only nigga in the city, million dollars a car

How you kick it with the goon, you meant to be with the star





Turn down for what

Made a few mill off two flows

Big dog, Cujo

Your man here, you mad now

In the booty club, I'm the cash cow

We turning up, we broke the knob up

I'm on Xanex, trying not to nod off

Finna bust your bitch like a sawed off

Making NBA money, I'm a ball hog

Big blunts and nigga still facing

Bank account look like The Matrix

Niggas be acting still hating

I'm rich and I stay super faded

Pouring up that Bombay, let that reefer burn

Getting... by your bitch, my nigga wait your turn

Groupie bitches on my balls

Got them dancing with the stars

Once a million dollar nigga

Half a million dollar cars

Have to love them ratchet bitches

They get 2 Live with the Crew

Make them pop that pussy open

Man I feel like Uncle Luke
