You will if you didn't feel it before

Ever since I was a kid never really been bored

Swinging from building to building with my umbilical chord

But they don't know what I really endured

They say Godzilla been summoned but we're not running

Attila the Hun is coming, we’re killin his horde

Spilling my innards, I fell on my sword

And now my blood is filling up from ceiling to floor

I'm swimming though it, I'm swallowing fluid

Knew I had to do it so I grew like a million gills

Cause evolution is kill or be killed

Your Mrs. isn't equipped to be having kids

Have her listen to what I'm spitting

It’s like sniffing fertility pills

This illegitimate village idiot bridging original shit with digital

Catching a carrier pigeon, sticking a chip in his wing and hitching a ride

But there's a glitch in the system inside

Got this ambition, I'm keeping the freshest fish in my kitchen

I catch em quick when get em to bite (right)

This kind of killing could fill a pelican bill

And my delicatessen will keep my recipe tight (right)

You kinda Gollumy, go ahead try to follow me

But if you're solid we build a colony, bruh

Calling Me Maybe, they popping molly

These babies are sniffling like they're chuggin some quality phở



…I’m playing with the house’s money now, cause I thought we were on our way out during the Cuban Missile Crisis. I was, ah, in my late teens—I fell asleep waiting for the missile to fall dead center on my apartment, crash through the ceiling, and that was gonna be the end of everything. And I was amazed when I woke up the next morning and I was still alive…



If you want to lose your home (Bet against me)

And every penny you own (Bet against me)

You want to eat your words (Bet against me)

You want your feelings hurt (Bet against me)

You want your ego bruised (Bet against me)

If you like to lose (Bet against me)

If you love regret (Bet against me)

You want to die in debt (Bet against me)

If you want to shed tears (Bet against me)

You want to lose ten years (Bet against me)

If you got too much wealth (Bet against me)

If you fuckin hate yourself (Bet against me)
