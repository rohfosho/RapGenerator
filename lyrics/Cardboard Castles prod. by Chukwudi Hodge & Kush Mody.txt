Out on the curb again

On the curb again

I’ve come to learn it’s hard and firm

Out on the curb again



I’m in my room making cardboard castles

With shoestring rope

Soup spoon drawbridge

Tinfoil moat

I’m still dreaming after all these years



Because if we don’t build it who will?

I do things on a shoestring that you couldn’t do for a cool mil

I run with no laces, and when I fall, I start

To build my Taj Mahal with shit I found at Dollarmart

This life’s our greatest project

The journey’s all an art

But I built my perfect nest, and it’s ‘bout to fall apart

Again and again and then I just I make it twice as high

And I give my tower teeth, and I watch it bite the sky

Because I might just cry if I don’t keep it moving

I focus on what I can make and not what just got ruined

‘Cause every stone will crumble down to dust, to dust, to dust

And I say love thy neighbor, and I say fuck thy hater

There’s nothing I can’t solve with duct tape and construction paper

I don’t want a Band-Aid, I’ll only rip it off, I’ll rip it off





I know someday I’ll pass, and maybe then rest

I’m laying on my back;

Heaven’s my bench press

‘Cause my imagination is crazy as Glenn Beck

A cloud is floating by in the shape of a rent check

And when the world ends, that’s what I’ll plan towards

Then I’ll trust girlfriends and maybe landlords

Cause I been played but I’m looking for more

I say, "What would I gain if I took it to court?"

‘Cause if people were perfect then there wouldn’t be war

We stay pushing but once we get a foot in the door

We get our toes chopped off and a foot of manure

I still gotta believe people

Are good at the core

‘Cause if we weren’t, what’s at stake?

Why would we stay to break what we make

And create all these beautiful mistakes

When they blow our house down let’s draw on the walls, the walls, the walls
