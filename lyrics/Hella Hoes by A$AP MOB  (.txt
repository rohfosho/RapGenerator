[Intro: A$AP Nast]
Hoes, I got hella hoes
I got hoes, I got hella hoes
I got hoes, and I'm selling dope
And I just bought that chopper and that pistol with the scope

[Hook: A$AP Nast]
Hoes, I got hella hoes
I got hoes, I got hella hoes
I got hoes, and I'm selling dope
And I just bought a chopper, let that pussy nigga know I got

[Verse 1: A$AP Twelvyy]
I got a start in these streets, extra hard for these hoes
We move hard in these streets, young God, X'ing them O's
I'm like God in these streets, got a tech in my coat
I go hard in these streets, Johnny Depp with the blow
I flip nickels and O's, I flip powder in bass
I done shoveled the snow, I done showered the state
See them flowers gone grow and the power gon' raise
And we came through the door, here we got us a race

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
All these diamonds in my teeth
I'm gone off a gallon of Hennessy
Better let your bitch go cause she's feeling me
And besides she a ho, she fucked him and me
And I gave her the beast like I'm Timothy
Moonwalk in that pussy like Billie Jean
And I open your chest like you Janet Jackson
And I blam-blam like you Timberlake
I put him in a lake and I penetrate
Let it sit in your face like a dinner date
Then bust open your grill, let it ventilate
And my niggas is killers, what can I say?
With a crew of gorillas like 50 Cent
And they peelin' bananas, no dinner plate
And I'm only gone ride with my syndicate
A$AP 'til I die, nigga, period

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, pretty mothafucka, pull up in this bitch like
Uh, jiggy mothafucka, hella hoes on my dick like
Uh, really with the shit, if a nigga trip, loading up the clip
Never slip, tight, never sleep, finna let it rip in this bitch like
Pistols poppin', pussies droppin'
Niggas coppin', bottles poppin'
Roxies choppin', Oxycontin, word to A$AP Lotto
Live down Collins mobbin' slow
Syrup got me throwed, mouth is full of gold
If I overdose, just let 'em know
Alright, I got hella hoes

[Hook] x2
