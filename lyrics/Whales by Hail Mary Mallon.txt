Money (x29)

Motherfucker



Money on my motherfucking mind

Cop five haircuts at the same time

White gold pants, jet ski made of wine

Foie gras bust of Albert Einstein

Get Money



Money out my motherfucking mouth

A mansion, a ranch, and a camp and a town

A motherfucking store with a floor made of scalps

Bobby from the block don't got rocks, he got Alps

Get Money



Money in the motherfucking jar

Shark fin pastry

Summers on Mars

Twenty motherfuckers in a levitating car

Seven-forty-seven full of women and cigars

Get money



Money in the motherfucking pot

A castle full of cars and the yard full of yachts

A leopard with a mink

And an arm full of clocks

All hand wound everyday by a Spock

Get money





Money is a motherfucking joke

Forty bald eagles sewn onto a coat

Zoo with the crib, mermaid in the moat

Buy another strip mall every eighth note

Get money



Money ain't a motherfucking prob

It's a sport I invented to win when I watch

And own all the rights and the lights and the locks

Even own all the ice in the Sprite you just dropped

Get money



Money or your motherfucking life

Two ton angel carved outta ice

Alligator sailboat, dollar sign eyes

Fill a warehouse full of Van Goghs twice

Get money



Money or your motherfucking heart

I could give it to my dog

He makes money when he barks

Or put it in my fridge

Or in one of my parks that i bought

So my robots could learn how to LARP

Get money
