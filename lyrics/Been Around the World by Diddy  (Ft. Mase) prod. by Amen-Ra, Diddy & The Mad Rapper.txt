This Mase, you know what I'm saying

You got niggas that don't like me for whatever reason

You got niggas that don't wanna see me rich

You got niggas that's mad cause I'm always with they bitch

Then you got niggas that just don't like me

You know the, those PHD niggas

But you know I pop a lot of shit but I back it up though

See it's a difference

A lot of niggas pop shit

But a lot of niggas don't make hits

But it's like this whole Bad Boy shit

We come to bring it to y'all niggas, me, B.I., Puff, Lox, whoever, Black Rob

If you wanna dance, we dance



Now trick what

Lace who

That ain't what Mase do

Got a lot of girls that'd love to replace you

Tell you to your face boo not behind your back

Niggas talk shit, we never mind that

Funny never find that, Puff a dime stack

Write hot shit and make a nigga say, rewind that

Niggas know, we go against the Harlem Gigolo

Getcha ho, lick her low, make the bitch hit the door

I represent honeys with money fly guys with gems

Drive with the tints that be thirty-five percent

Hoes hope I lay so I look both ways

Cop says okay my tint smoke gray

No way, nigga leave without handing me my shit

Got plans to get my Land and my six

Niggas outta pen'll understand this shit

Pop champagne like I won a championship



Been around the world and I I I

And we been playa hated

I don't know and I don't know why

Why they want us faded

I don't know why they hate us

Is it our ladies or our drop Mercedes

Baby, baby



I was in one bedroom, dreaming of a million

Now I'm in beach houses, cream to the ceiling

I was a gentleman living in tenements

Now I'm swimming in all the women that be tens

Went from Bad Boys to the Crushed Linen Men

Now my divi-dends be the new Benjamins

Hoes of all complexions

I like cinnamon

Mase you got some hoes well nigga send em in

What you waiting for, let the freak show begin

How they came in a truck? (Nah Puff, that's a Benz...)

Mercedes, c'mere baby, you don't like the way

It's hot and hazy, never shady, you must be crazy

It's ridiculous how you put your lips on this

Don't kiss right there girlfriend I'm ticklish

And I be switching fees with a wrist full of G's

Nigga please, I'm the macaroni with the cheese





Now Puff rule the world even though I'm young

I make it my biz to see that all ladies cum

Get em all strung from the tip of my tongue

Lick em places niggas wouldn't dare put they faces

Before I die, hope I, remake a flow by

In the brand new treasure on a old try

Now when my throat dry, even when the smoke lie

Eat the Mami chocha and drive her loca

We never ride far, packed five in a car

Save money for the drinks

I'm about to buy the bar

And everywhere I drive I'm a star

Little kids all on the corner scream, that's my car

It was days couldn't be fly, now I'm in a T.I

Come in clubs with B.I., now a nigga V.I

Rock tons of gold, nuff money I fold

Roll the way you wanna roll, break a hundred at the toll







OK after these messages we'll be back with

The Mad Rapper and his brother the Mad Producer, after this

*applause*

OK just sit back, relax, and enjoy yourself

We'll get you through this
