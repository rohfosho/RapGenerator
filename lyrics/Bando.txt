[Hook: Quavo]
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trapped out the bando, trapped out the bando
Trapped out the bando, trapped out the bando
Trapped out the bando, trapped out the bando
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trap, trapping out the house with the boards on the windows

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Trapped out the bando, got tools like Rambo
Got bird like Birdman, got white like Lindsay Lohan
Made a hundred stacks off the pots and pans
On the corner serving grams, my niggas be on the block hard
My niggas be selling that hard, got bricks, like Shaq, at the free throw
You can call my phone, got them prices for the L-O, don't knock at my door, I don't wanna talk to you
Got them bricks for the low, I will serve you
In the bando, boarded up, got them bricks in the wall and in the floor
Pizzeria way I'm playin' with the dough
If the feds wanna talk, I just tell them I don't know
Fuck twelve!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Offset]
Trapping in the vacant, serving all my patients
Get it from the Haitians, smoking loud my eye look Asian
Getting to the money, running to it, tryna chase it
Like it when she make it, cook it when she naked
Throw it in the microwave, Betty Crocker how I bake it
Trapping in the bando, big guns like commando
Flip it like a sandal, foreign bitch she look like J.Lo
Get a brick from Venezuelo, meet the plug his name is Pedro

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
All new Camaro with the black and red interior
Migo gang taking over, yeah we is superior
Certified packs nigga you can check the serial
Foreign bad bitch and she say her name Trina
Traphouse look like it got hit by hurricane Katrina
These pounds bought a beamer, everything I do illegal
The bitches always wanna mingle, I'm stacking my money like pringles
Sipping on sprite and codeine, my foreign bitch Philippine
Her girlfriend Chinese, sipping on lean and popping a bean
Diamonds come from Africa, sipping on lean and smoking loud
Feel like I'm on salvia, flipping the work with no spatula
