Lot of grievances and wish tales on the wrong niggas

K's sound like grey hounds, they long winded

Week start, high school sweetheart, what's wrong with him?

Black snake moan, tre-eight long as bone tissue

Lay on side my son and he's like ''Daddy, what's wrong?''

Few elusive habits, won't consider marriage I'm gone

I've been shot, I've been stabbed, had like cheap liquor

Slipped then got back on my feet like C. Billups

I done lost my money gambling, loudmouth rambling

Did a lot of lying 'til my women couldn't stand it

Nigga killed my brother so I took him from his family

Went and got some tears in my face, now I'm branded

All I ever wanted was some money like Sandy

Louise Vuitton shades for my dame, life fancy

Sweet face then I lick her pussy like nasty

But I ain't like her boyfriend if you was just asking



Wait, who is this?

Ayo, wait, I don't know

I'm doing this XXL shit, I can't really talk on the phone right now



Smack called me, I was getting some head

He said ''come do this XXL cover instead''

I said ''for sure, bust a bitch on the bed

Bust a nut on her head, tell me when and where and it's dead''

In the moment feels like a rush don't it?

Me hopping on the plane to fly to New York with no advance

From my non-existent label to spend

Money I'm spent, funded my tour in Europe

Paid it for myself

When a bunch of nigga's labels probably paid for the spot

I don't know, maybe not, could've been genuine

I laugh at Mr.Rogers in the hood

Told him why these niggas is brokeboys, they need reassembling

I'm Wimbledon, used to be innanet, now I'm a free man like Morgan

Free agent, three agents, the A&R man and a midget on my foreskin

Hey, Kobe, tell me how my ass taste

They should save my shit for the outtakes

I might take everyone out, flee the scene with the murder weapon

And a dick in your mouth, feet on your couch and my middle finger's up With my fucking Timb spot cause I don't give a fuck



Be on my grind and my hustle all day

Baby, I'mma shine, keep it bright always

And I be on the grind on the block all day

I'mma hustle all day, I'mma hustle all day

You know I'mma grind, I'mma hustle all day

And baby I'mma shine like a light always

You know I'mma grind, I'mma hustle all day

I'mma hustle all day, I'mma hustle all day, yeah



Look, I'm on this XXL getting this paper

What I told her, she was slick as a fox

Sweet as the cadence, tell me, baby, you gon' love me or not?

With my dick in her mouth

I'm just chilling, my eyes glued to the ceiling

Just imagine getting closer to God

My uncle tried to stand on money then grab on something

Then have no knots and have no nothings and can't afford that

Swerving, just left service with Aunt Berlin

The Drama got her busy, this tenant is cart serving

Serving a junkie, maybe his family or something

That said that math just be exquisite when we pimping them bitches

Don't twist a cabinet in the kitchen unless you working them riches

Hold up, but we continue, we ain't washing no dishes

Laughing niggas laughing to the cashier

I don't really give a fuck

Getting to acting baffled, should not crash ya

Told you you'd get it, nigga



Young black boy, how he got the labels scared?

A&R's like be "Chano, you ain't playin fair"

You gon' set a bad example for the average bear

You a yogi, you should idle while in child's position

I be like, naw, these my sons, this prenatal care

I'mma show 'em how to make it here and make it fair

Take it there they could kill me and I ain't gon' care

You is just an ankle weight, lighter than some angel cake

Sweeter than some maple syrup, easier than ableton

Make a plate and make it player, make 'em play it

Just don't count your sheep before they hatch

You chickens 'fore your eggs or eat your dinner 'fore you say your prayer
