Ass fat, yeah I know, you just got cash?
Blow sum mo', blow sum mo', blow sum mo'
The more you spend it, the fast it go
Bad bitches, on the floor, It's rainin' hundred's
Throw sum mo', trow sum mo', throw sum mo', throw sum mo'

[Verse 1: Slim Jimmy]
Hi, bye hater, I flood the club with paper
Shorty got a ass, some for now, some for later
Somethin' like Nicki's, dancin' like Maliah
I'm throwin' all this money, Imma fuck around and buy her
I can flick the money all night, 'til my wrist tired
If you put in work, this the night you gon' retire
You a bad bitch, I ain't even gon' deny her
She told me, throw that money, I said, make it worth my while
I'm 'bout to empty out the ATM
She doin' tricks that make a nigga wanna spend
Girl you know you got me fascinated
Just keep on dancin' 'til I'm outta paper

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
Franklin's, rainin' on your body
Rainin' on your body, rainin' on your body
Won't you do what I say, start rubbin' on your body
You like hundred's on your body, girl, you need to get naughty
Hold up, hold on, her eyes on me, is that your ho?
If so, Imma get her 'fore the nights over
DJ play my shit, so, I'm finna crank up, off in the VIP zone
See the money go up and she dance on sight
By the end of the night she on endo
Lemme see you make it clap on tempo
Lemme see you get low, like limbo

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Come in ho, mistletoe, I got birdies, crows
Flip it a bit, wanna jump on the dick
I'm like bool, let's get it, let's get it
I got these bitches kissin' on these bitches
I can't even count 'em, I fuck by the digits
Swag terrific, I might fuck that bitch in the kitchen
Baby, don't use dirty dishes, or else you might whip up a BURRRR!
My neck, my wrists is a BURRRR!
She wanna fuck my dogs, I'm like, woof
Panoramic roof, I drop the coupe, boo
Pulled up with a bitch, she look like New New
It's okay if I lie to you, bitch, I swear the truth
Hey, she come right back, like 'em divers do
Fifty thousand off fifty niggas, no caliber
