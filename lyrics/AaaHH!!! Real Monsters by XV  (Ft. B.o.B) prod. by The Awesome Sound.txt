Play them, play them, play them loud

Yeah, all night

Comin' down, bangin' that new shit



From the moment you said I was over my head

I wrote on my hand your name in my Grammy speech

(You made a monster out of me)

My label tried to change me, well congratulations

Now look what you made me, I done turned to a motherfuckin' beast

(You made a monster out of me)

And I will go wherever you take me

But the only place you drive me is crazy, cause baby

(You made a monster out of me)

And magazines said I couldn't blow like Lohan

Now I'm making all my haters Earl, no ToeJam

Mess with me and I am on your head like Zohan

Flocka no hands, that is no man, that's a monster



Real monsters, real monsters

Real monsters, play it, play it, play it loud



They say, "Put on for us, make us proud"

On top so see me now

If you hate don't make a sound

Play it, play it, play it, loud



When they see him with the green shock the world like Blanka

Whipping through the city in a Phantom of the opera

Tell every interview and blogger

(You made a monster out of me)

So I dressed up in a old tux

Smoked four blunts then I took a horcrux

Buried myself alive, now look what woke up

(You made a monster out of me)

And my ex girl said I wouldn't make it

Now she ass-naked

Revenge so sweet on her knees make her taste it

And I'm just sayin'

(You made a monster out of me)

But what you ain't make is a dude from the midwest

Who grind for ten years just to get himself these big checks

I am overkill, Cloverfield meet T-Rex

What's that mean X? That just means that

I'm a monster





Mom told me that I need to grow up

I was in the room trying to blow up

Could only get an eighth, I'm tryna roll up, turn up

(You made a monster out of me)

Yeah, she was on her own and could do well with the support and

Thank God that you didn't get that abortion

And thank you for them J's, man them shits was so important

(You made a monster out of me)

Homies laughin' and girl done left me

Just borrow money, now I'm owin' like Jesse

Same clothes, underarms smell zesty

(You made a monster out of me)

But now I got a whole new steez, polo tees

Matchin' drawers, suck on these

And yes the honeys all on me from the way I be's

Lil' Q, Figg Street, bitch now couldn't be

Can I sit 'em down

Top Dawg bow wow





Look what you did to me, look what you started

Now this middle finger's higher than the planes in Laguardia

There'll be no apologies, don't beg for my pardon

Sir, you'll just look retarded, so get the fuck off it

Listen, they know I done been with beast mode

Been turned up, ya'll niggas late to the party

Been caked up, ain't no fake in this balling

Got accounts overseas that they can't even audit

So be aware of the angel of death known as debt

You just living now-a-days to protect head and neck

That's a billion lost souls that the government collects

In the belly of the beast and she harvesting a nest

That's why I never sleep, tell me what the fuck is rest?

Niggas thought I sold my soul for the money and respect

But I ain't playing checkers my nigga I'm playing chess

So checkmate, exit now, stage left motherfucker
