Whoa whoa whoa

What do you take us for?



I'm a phenomenon, and I gotta bring pain in The Octagon

When I wanna spit game at a soccer mom

I get it quicker than the left lane in the Autobahn, fast

Like Ramadan, and I battle young padawans all the damn day

I'm getting naked and I'm hopping on a wrecking ball

So hot, I got the motherfucker a la flambé

I go to Miley's house, I see that Miley's home

I play Miley's ribcage with my dick, like it's a Xylie-phone

Yes, that was highly fucked up but my skills are highly honed

And if I was highly hyphy, I might be more widely-known

C'est la vie, better pay my fee

They kick it in Seattle in a Patagonia jacket

They get it in the Bay in a plain white tee

Hey mami! You a P.Y.T

You wanna see me speak, then I go, go, go, go!

Cause, every time I get a beat, I know I gotta beat it up

I bend it then I break it then I chop it then I eat it up

And PETA would never approve of the way

I've been treating the music, I bleed it, I bruise it

I kick it to the curb and then I'm sipping on my bourbon

I be freaking it, doing it, keeping it moving

I'm picking apart the muscle when I'm thinking about the hustle

But I'm nice, nice!





I jump the freeway median, I'm savage

Cause my mode is that I'm meaner than the average

Like my teacher taught me when I heard the crowd applaud

I thought I was an atheist until I realized I'm a God

It could hurt a bit when I murder shit

In a moment, I'll be tying off a tourniquet

When I burn them and I hit them in the sternum

I don't even got to enter, but I'm gonna win the tournament

That's what I'm all about

I do what I got to do and never gonna pout

And I hope that it would have been the end of it and I'm out

But they never tend to give me the benefit of the doubt

Ever since I was a little kid

I know that I've been looking for the hot, hot spotlight

And if you really wonder what I think about the competition

They were not-not-not tight

I've been reading my scripture

Every photo bomber wanna be in my picture

And you better bet I'm living every single day

Like it's the motherfucking Catalina Wine Mixer

Bada bing, bada boom!

When I walk in, I'm the king of the room

And I get it locked in like the king in a tomb

When I spit a toxin and they cough on the fumes

Cause I'm back in the nick of time and attacking the fickle mind

I'm a jackal, I'll rip his hide, I'ma tackle him, pick a fight

I be Dracula, set to bite in the black of the bitter night

And I'm out, poof
