Every day a star is born (And you say New York City!)

Clap for em, clap for em, clap for em

Every day a star is born

Clap for em, clap for em, clap for em

Hey!



I seen Mase do it, I seen Ye do it

X came through, caught lighter fluid

Still I came through it

Clap for em

But I’m the blueprint

I’m like the map for em

I dropped another classic

Made Puff pass it

Nobody could touch Puff back when Puff had it

Wayne scorching, I'll applaud him

If he keep going, pass the torch to him

50 came through like hurricanes do

I thought I'd finish his ass at Summer Jam too

I had the Illmatic on bootleg

The shit was so ahead, thought we was all dead

Wayne did A Milli, 50 did a milli

Ye too, but what Em did was silly

The white boy blossomed after Dre endorsed him

His flow on Renegade, fucking awesome

Applaud him





Snoop dogged it, Nelly came down

The Face Mob, kept it ghetto for the H town

Luda moved digits after he moved bitches

Drake’s up next, see what he do with it

Rule had a run, couple movie parts

T.I. literally wanted to shoot up the charts

What up Jeezy, what it do

Y’all remind me of us in early '92

Outkast landed, 3 thou was ill

Like a male version of Lauryn Hill

Mobb Deep shook it but Prodigy took it a lil' too far

Can’t fuck with Brooklyn

Wu-Tang gangbanged it, Meth ate

Rae took on the date with the Purple Tape

Passed on to Ason and then Ghostface

They had a hell of a run

Standing ovate, ayyy





And I am one of one

Can’t you see just how long my run

My reign Lulu's son shine

Been a star since I was back in one time

One time give it up for him

December 4th a star was born

Clap for him

He went from moving that corner

To this corner office is so enormous

Hey, Pres Carter

Watch them get they Monica on all day

Hey

Got so many different monikers but only 1 Jay

They come, they go

Some real, some faux

Some friends, some hoes

But no, I goes nowhere, this Hov





And could I be a star

Does fame in this game have to change who you are?

Or could I be the same one who came from a far away life

Just to make it in these Broadway lights?

Now shining in the broad day light, go figure

A slow transition from a little broke nigga from the Ville

Got a deal, a real life saver

Dreams of being behind the wheel like Jada

I chill now...cop a little ice later

Cole you got the glow like a lil' lightsaber

So clap for him, then applaud Hov

He gave him a platform

Flow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him

No sir

The flow's cold as a shoulder

Of gold digging hoes when a broke nigga approaches

Told ya I’m focused man

I’ll let you motherfuckers soak it in
