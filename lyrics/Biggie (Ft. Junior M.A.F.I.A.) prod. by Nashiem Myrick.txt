Queen Bee, and Notorious B.I.G. nigga

The best that ever lived, the best that ever did it

The best that ever lived it

Cocksuckers, What's his name, huh?

That's how we do it ya'll

To all my niggas in the house

Bad Boy, Who we die for

All day, everyday nigga



For the love of BIG, we bang out

Since my man died, we don't hang out

We blow brains out, we tear the club up pullin things out

Mafia World, all my niggas max out

We Bad Boys, why ya'll niggas cracked out

Coward niggas, most are burried down south

Far from gangstas, really hush puppies

Niggas bearly speak when we discuss money

Niggas stay yappin when there's always somethin funny

The realest niggas never took nuthin from me

Rock ice, stay jig, fuck with niggas that got drunk, and hate kids

Got niggas on state bids, that hate movies like Rosewood and Matrix

A yo, Biggie taught me well, Biggie told me how to flip bricks like cartwheel



Chorus: Lil' Cease & Notorious B.I.G



To all my thugs who puffed him

To all my girls who hugged him

You love him, yell his name..



I'd rather die on my feet, than live on my knees

Nigga please, I cock and squeeze for..



Mafia



Representin Bucktown

Mack 11's cocked back, niggas better duck down

Face down, you know the routine, the cream

Earings, you know the drama Biggie bring



For BIG I learn to grip aim and cock it

Once I got it, I lock it

Banger, big city boy with deep pockets

See me speak, that paper better be the topic

I like my ice frozen like the Antartic

I'm quick to finish it, your good to start it

And with the flashy colors on, you just a target, Waitin for a hard hit

I like marine blue, marine green, roll with a mean team

Meshed out, fresh out, and stay greams

We big boys, we do big things, born in this county of kings

I ain't got shit, I spread things, take things

Fuck whenever my mood swings, from the summer for the winter to the spring

My nigga ill's holdin it down for the beam

Like BIG said, we do the real things, we still bubble and steal chains

Still tustle, still struggle, we feel pain

Still ride, still die for BIG's name



(chorus)



For BIG I grip the cig, put six in your wig

Not cause of what he said, cause of what he did

When I hear that pop quiz, that's the way I was raised and thats the way it is for..

We roll like the Panthers, show our guns on camera

Do jokes with police scanners, niggas mediocre, full of dirt like hampers

I roll with a bunch of niggas that wear bandanas and rep...

We kept it thurough, from the heart ripped the barrel

B.K. style, see BIG howl, now

Lets see who, wanna go against Mafia world

Niggas nuthin but squirels, they know we rep...

Niggas tryin to get a nut, hit in the head or below the gut

Wood style roll'em up, get plucked, nigga what

Go back to spend a ton, and know cats wit gold tooths

Know my gat and bust for my nigga...



(chorus)



Now when I cock back and squeeze, my Desert E'z

Make you drop to your knees, barely able to breathe

My bullets move in threes, one for Brook-lyn

One for Mafia so take that, Uh, and this one's for...

You know Frank kept me iced out

Mink dragon, seven figures in my bank account

All that material shit, ya'll still tryin to get it

Uh, you fuckin pricks, get off his dick tryin to be like...

All ya'll lame ass niggas keep my man name out your mouth

Or get this shit right, check it, it's the B-I, double G-I, E

Ya'll niggas can't see Poppa, nor the Big Moma

Who you love... for the Y2G, the two ten

We got it sewn, we don't need ya'll help, we hold our own

Cause this goes out to cats not tryin to give it up

BIG missin us, shout him out...
