Won a gold medal, and a gold bezel

I treat it so special, now ya ho jealous

Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better

I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter!



When I slide down the ave I'm fuckin' trippin' (damn)

Maserati bat black, all I wanna know is where the cash at?

TNT tucked in my 'rillo, hundred racks under my pillow

Different styles, I'm so versatile, nigga you know like I know

Jimmy, Lil Swae, hoes on the chase

Cash in the air make her forget her date

Heard of my plan, she fuckin' with me anyway

If she thicky like Nicki I put that pussy on my plate

How you not notice the flyest niggas in the place?

I hit the liquid and started drippin' into space

Hublot tickin', blowin' kisses at your baby

Have fun, shotkilla like Mike reincarnated

Throwin' out a fuckin' end

I'm blowin' money in the wind

I'm sick of wearin' skinny jeans

I'm more into wearin' Louis V's

These hoes don't fuckin' listen

These niggas don't pay attention

These bitches are not yours

We keep them on all fours

Breakin' down', rollin' up potent

Sippin' champagne like soda, poppin' red bitches like cola

Trunk beat like Eardrummers

Sremm killed the haters, God bless 'em

Mothafuckas still all in my bone marrow

Flyin' through the air like a fuckin' air devil

All these broke niggas just fish in a barrel

Run back up and I turn into a bezel



No flex zone, no flex zone

They know better, they know better

No flex zone, no flex zone

They know better, they know better

Won a gold medal and a gold bezel

I treat it so special, now ya ho jealous

Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better

I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter!



Hell no you can't use my lip gloss

Pop a perc' now I'm on lift off

Ass still fat, it's on Rick Ross

You bitches, make a nigga dick soft

Bitch ball like I'm at tip off

Get it wet, then I rub the tip on

Rag and Bone jeans I can slip off

Bitch I've been hot since flip phones

Running this game for 5 years

Guess that's why my feet hurt

Wonder when they bite me

Do these bitches' teeth hurt?

Yes I am an icon, that's me on your T-shirt

….THOUGHT YOU KNEEEEEEWW BET-TER!

Do your fucking research

You ain’t know this the no rip zone

This the "You can’t beat Nic” zone

Madison Square when the Knicks home

I live next door to Brad Pitt’s home

I like bad bitches, cause they like bad bitches too

I like hood niggas, with a bad attitude

They could never reach Young Nick, magnitude

Even if they had a longitude, latitude

Listen up ho, this is my territory

You are my son, like an episode of Maury

Like an episode of ER, bitch I’m hotter than the D.R

When it comes to rap skills, nobody wanna see her (seer/CR)

Motherfuckers flexin, motherfuckers acting (actors, A.R)

Bitches is my sons and they causin' contractions

Ain’t pushing out, I'ma give them to the clinic

Cah wait, we nuh rate dem gyal and dem gimmick

Wack sauce I can hear it in your tone

This nigga keep staring at my phone

But if you’re ugly it’s a no text zone

It’s a no sex zone, it’s a no flex zone

Wack sauce I can hear it in your tone

This nigga keep staring at my phone

But if you’re ugly it’s a no text zone

It’s a no sex zone, it’s a no flex zone





Who ain't waiting on King Push?

Got niggas checking for them new flows

Sold more dope than the old Jigga

Now niggas calling me the new Hov

Let the coupe go, planetarium

Let the roof go like Cesarean

Clear my section nigga, no flexing nigga

Just a hunnid bottles they carrying

Cross the border like I lost a daughter

This foreign nigga, he ain't know better

Him pick and choose where them bullets fly

I lose the plane on this fool nigga

Bought dope with my album budget

Play Cloths was the blueprint

Four million in four seasons

Fuck who care for my fashion sense

Tell a ho come and swim in the money (splash)

Broke niggas just stop at the heel

I could body paint you in them name brands

And put a red bow on the wheels

See I'm just in and out, I call a rent a mouth

Suck the ice out of a bezel

Use my rap persona, fuck baby mommas

Still killin' haters, God bless em'
