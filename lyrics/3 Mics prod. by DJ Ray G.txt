I came from mug shots
To posters on the block
Keep our song on replay
Now all we need is 3 Mics and a DJ
3 Mics and a DJ x3
Know 3 young niggas on the North
By name of Quavo, Offset and Takeoff
We mobbing pull up at your house
Squad open the trunk and I pull out that sawed off
Cutomuto he gone cut your throat, Migos dressed in the cut knock your jaw off
I came from bitches staring at me
Now when they see me they taking their top off
Brazilians, Snow Bunnies, and I like Dominicans
Gold on my Giuseppe Steppers, red on the bottom on my Christian Louboutins
I used to be jugging, finessing, remixing the plug on the island like Gillegan
I gave em a flow, and they stealing it
The block on fire, I can extinguish it
3 mics 3 mics 3 mics nigga that changed my life
Mama she told me get right
No more standing over the stove at night
Now I rock the stage and I get paid, it's 50k in my resume
Remember hitting licks in the Honda
Now I'm riding round president tints on a escalate
Picking hard ball like the Braves
Rocking out shows on the gravey
I told my mama we made it, Harriet Tubman chains no slavery
Breaking the sweat like the 80's
Play with the water like Navy
My niggas really in the field
3 mics we don't need a fucking deal
Back in the day a flamingo DJ Ray G playing Bando
That was the number one single
Bitches wanna come and mingle
Zonatti Guiseppe wrapped round my socks
We came along way from mug shots
Ducking and dodging the cops Ray G to me Offset stop
Offset never listen had to do a sentence when i got out we took to the top
They say when you worth a milli thats a different feeling
Wanna know benji im the definition
3 mics and a DJ shot fired on the freeway
Cooking the dope will get bagged like a replay
Running circles around you squares no relay
.
