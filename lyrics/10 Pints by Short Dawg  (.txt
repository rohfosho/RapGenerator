10 pints in my backpack, 10 pounds in the trunk
10 hoes in the backseat and they all tryna get fucked
10 pints in my backpack, 10 pounds in the trunk
10 hoes in the backseat, backseat, backseat
90's flow, mid though, catch us crawlin' in that Caddy
There he go, smokin' dope, man I swear it came from Papi (Hola)
Ab-Soul, so you know, don't be actin' unfamiliar
West Side, Del Amo, I got it tatted on my spirit
Spiritual, 10 hoes, hostage in the CTS
Lambo, windows up, that molly might make them undress
Oh for sure, Soulo ho­e, minus E and add the 3
3 eyes to the third, word to the 33
Holy shit, who is this? They call me the God MC
Perform miracles and shit, I turn water into lean
Man I'm always gettin' shaded cause I stay around some tree
Man I'm always gettin' faded, but no barbershop for me
10 pints in my backpack, 10 pounds in the trunk
10 hoes in the backseat and they all tryna get fucked
10 pints in my backpack, 10 pounds in the trunk
10 hoes in the backseat and they all tryna have fun

I got 10 pounds in the trunk, 10 pints in my backpack
I made 10 racks off 10 to 4s, I spit crack, need 10 a show
Keep bad chicks with their skin exposed, my hoes thicker than winter clothes
10 deep so they finna roll, gon' lap up, girl, make some space
10 pints in my backpack, more seals than a naval base
I stole a 6, I'ma drink an 8, the other deuce, I'm gon' save it
I know these rapper dudes hate it when they hear me on their boo's playlist
It's Young Fresh and my dues paid, fresh pair of cool greys
And I keep pounds on me, like I'm in the U.K
I'm on point like Jeremy Lin, and I'm reppin' that H-Town
Soon as all of her girls is in, I made 'em bust it like Greyhound
That's right, I'm a man, ho, haters cannot stand Short
No matter if it's made by Gucci, Louis V or Jansport, I
10 mil' in my back pocket, 20 thou on these rap watches
Talkin' money, nah that's obnoxious, fuck these hoes, pass chronic
Came through, easily, Ab-Soul the new Eazy-E
Talkin' shit, leave him be, I'm chiefin' weed, watchin' DVDs
Eatin' 5 star meals in my home
My crib look like Johnny Depp's in Blow
Got a cast around my arm, but I'm still smackin' rappers
Don't fuck with these bars, no homie, that's disaster
Sittin' on a couple million
Will please someone give Vince a fuckin' Cinnabon (Aye, I'm hungry nigga)
You talkin' shit but where your facts at?
