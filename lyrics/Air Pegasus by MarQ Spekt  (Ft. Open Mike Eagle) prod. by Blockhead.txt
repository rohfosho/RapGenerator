Look one day I won't even need a barber
I'll buy a new jeep and sleep in a pizza parlor
Every cheap cigar is the best they could probably do
Limited resources plus other hobbies too
Imagine bad guys tied to fire wagons
Also apple pies and spies and sky dragons
Sociopaths choke who they supposed to hug
Midnight vultures love appropriating culture clubs
I like one clean tape fuck the overdub
And then I record seventeen singing parts
Deep yoga love supposed to be a secret art
Downward dog, hips straight with the feet apart
Still the beating heart rebuilt the leaning part
Cheap thrilled, feet build and kill with a cuisinart
The prodigal done is home from the lecture tour
I count three, who's the fourth table setting for?
They saying Spekt, why you chewin' like a rabid dog?
If he can't keep it what the hell you let him have it for?
That's your fault but y'already lack the gravitas
These phantom bars leave 'em floating like the planet Mars
A saboteur and booby traps throughout the catalogue
Stab 'em in the stomach, lift the blade and twist the handle off
Yeah, then leave some munchies for the weed heads
I like it better when y'all listen more, speak less
The look in her eyes will tell you that she eat fresh
Murdered the punani feeling guiltier than G-Dep
That's why they see em, he won't even give 'em a look
Casting lines off that rusty old fisherman hook
Kind of shocked they fell for the newest trick in the book
'Cuz it ain't really nothing more than a considerate jux
From a good polite kid who used a mask and a gun
Told his pops you only out to get that capital one
Ain't mean to kill him, we was just having some fun
Found his body vacuum sealed like a package of drugs
Praise a nimrod, when he blast immaculate slugs
And showed no honor for your honor turn his back to the judge
That's why they stay being ugly and repugnant
I almost beat 'em half to death with a drumstick
Save your assumptions, they really ain't want shit
And keep it hard as three pretty mouths on one dick
He got the beetles in his pinky
Every leader venal
The face line ate, I ain't street legal
Lead a pale horse in a ear tag some deer ticks
A winged horse to a queen's air strip, flares lit
Cut his own hair, chew his own chain
Might bang on a bucket with a lucite cane
Screws loose, quicker than a pit crew up fish news
Litter in the street, tricky slither in the mildew
POP go his temper, knock knock the fenders
Peck bound plots under cosmic embers
I'm a hot mess get your squad sequestered
Dock death, sleep on a bed of hot cobwebs
Freak with a set of goth potheads
Bleed rocks and fail smog checks
