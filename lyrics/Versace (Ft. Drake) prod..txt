Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'luminati

This is a gated community, please get the fuck off the property

Rap must be changin' cause I'm at the top and ain't no one on top of me

Niggas be wantin' a verse for a verse, but man that's not a swap to me

Drownin' in compliments, pool in the backyard that look like Metropolis

I think I'm sellin' a million first week, man I guess I'm a optimist

Born in Toronto but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us

What the fuck is you talkin' 'bout? Saw this shit comin' like I had binoculars

Boy, Versace, Versace, we stay at the mansion when we in Miami

The pillows' Versace, the sheets are Versace, I just won a Grammy

I've been so quiet, I got the world like "What the fuck is he plannin'?"

Just make sure that you got a back up plan cause that shit might come in handy

Started a label, the album is comin' September, just wait on it

This year I'm eatin' your food and my table got so many plates on it

Hundred inch TV at my house, I sit back like "damn I look great on it"

I do not fuck with your new shit, my nigga, don't ask for my take on it

Speakin' in lingo, man this for my nigga that trap out the bando

This for my niggas that call up Fernando to move a piano

Fuck all your feelin's cause business is business, its strictly financial

I'm always the first one to get it, man that's how you lead by example

Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace

Word to New York cause the Dyckman and Heights girls are callin' me "Papi"

I'm all on the low, take a famous girl out where there's no paparazzi

I'm tryna give Halle Berry a baby and no one can stop me



Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace

Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace

Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace

Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace



Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'Luminati

I know that you like it, Versace, my neck and my wrist is so sloppy

Versace, Versace, I love it, Versace the top of my Audi

My plug, he John Gotti, he give me the ducks, I know that they're mighty

Shoes and shirt Versace, your bitch want in on my pockets

She ask me why my drawers silk, I told that bitch "Versace"

Cheetah print on my sleeve, but I ain't ever been in the jungle

Try to take my sack, better run with it, nigga don't fumble





You can do Truey, I do it Versace

You copped the Honda, I copped the Mazi

You smoke the mid, I smoke exotic

I set the trend, you niggas copy

Cookin' this dope like I work at Hibachi

Look at the watch, blow it, hot like some Taki

Come in my room, my sheet Versace

Go to sleep, I dream Versace

Medusa, Medusa, Medusa

These niggas they wishin' they knew you

They coppin' the Truey, remixin' the Louis

My blunts is fat as Rasputia

In a striped shirt like I’m Tony the Tiger

I’m beatin' the pot, call me Michael

Lot of you niggas that copy

Look at my closet Versace, Versace





King of Versace, Medusa my wifey

My car is Versace, I got stripes on my Mazi

I'm dressin' so nicely they can't even copy

You'd think I'm Egyptian, this gold on my body

Money my mission, two bitches, they kissin'

My diamonds is pissin', my swag is exquisite

Young Offset no preacher but you niggas listen

Them blue and white diamonds, they look like the Pistons

Codeine sippin, Versace I’m grippin' them bands in my pocket

You know that I’m livin'

I’m draped up in gold, but no Pharaoh

Rockin' handcuffs, that’s Ferragamo

Bricks by the boat, overload

I think I’m the don, but no Rocco

This the life that I chose

Bought out the store, can’t go back no more

Versace my clothes while I’m sellin' them bows

Versace take over it took out my soul
