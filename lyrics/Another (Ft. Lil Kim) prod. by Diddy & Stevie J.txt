What do ya do when yo' bitch is untrue

Do you cut that hooker off and find someone new

I need another bitch (another bitch), in my life



I know he don't treat you like I treat you

Time to explain your game is see-through

Sex is lethal, I ain't gon' lie

Means to get ya back, I ain't gon' try

Like this y'all, my girl sucked anotha nigga dick y'all

Light skinned with the chromed out six y'all

Thought they was creepin, took trips to V-A every third weekend

While you was sleepin', he hit you on the box

Sixty-nine code non-stop

Shoulda left ya then, but my heart said not

You knew too much, the relationship grew too much

You knew about the crack vials, means to be trialed

Where I hid dough under the bathroom tile

Waited for a while, thought you was my right thing

Then things got frightening

Peep the scene, sorta like Sam Rothstein

Guess you Ginger, huh, go figure

Never thought you could be a gold-digger

Take my dough and spend with the next nigga

Asked my man Jigga, my ace boon coon

Told me cut the bitch off 'fore the shit balloon

Now I'm like Brandy, Sittin' in My Room

Pissy drunk listenin' to Stylistics tunes

Or the O'Jays, thinkin' bout the old days

My nigga's like, fuck that bitch, go play

Baller, when she beep you, don't call her

Guess who I seen, that freak bitch Paula

She was askin' bout ya whereabouts

Here's the digits, I know you can wear that out

Tear that out the frame, ya game so tight

We'll be all fucking tonight



What do ya do when your man is untrue

Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new

I need another man, in my life



Member when you said you would die for me, shit

All of that was just lies to me

Motherfucker shoulda never said bye to me

Now you cry for me, like Jodeci

It's like that y'all, my nigga hit another bitch from the back y'all

Black nasty and mad fat y'all; shoulda seen the ho

Nigga pack your shit, you out the do', ohh

What about the fight in The Mirage

I seen ya Benz parked outside my sister's garage

Said it was your friend Rog, bullshit

I ain't gonna keep puttin' up wit the bullshit

And still I, never sweat these bitches

Who be hanged like plaques on the wall with your pictures

Scale them fishes, my love is concrete

Stashin' your heat in the passenger seat

Of the Nautica Jeep, we've been down for so long

Still a bitch like me tryin' to hold on

Teary eyed, damn a bitch steamin'

Girls steady screamin', Kim you need to leave him

When I testified in court

Couldn't think straight thinkin' bout the bitches I fought over you

Nigga have the shit you bought

And fuck you, movin' is my last resort

You see, nine outta ten niggas ain't shit

One outta five niggas suck a dick

You're mad at me, too bad she ain't as bad as me

Shoulda kept the freak bitch off my canapé

Now you see, ain't no pussy warm as mine

Long as mine, ain't no love as strong as this

When I sucked your dick, it's like smokin' a roach
