Oh when it all, it all falls down

I'm telling you all, it all falls down

Oh when it all, it all falls down

I'm telling you all, it all falls down



Yeah, this the real one, baby

Uh, Chi-Town stand up

Southside, Southside

We gon' set this party off right

Westside, Westside

We gon' set this party off right



Man I promise, she's so self-conscious

She has no idea what she's doing in college

That major that she majored in don't make no money

But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny

Now, tell me that ain't insecurr

The concept of school seems so secure

Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr

She like, fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair

Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs

Cause her baby-daddy don't really care

She's so precious with the peer pressure

Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis

She had hair so long that it looked like weave

Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve

And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe

Single black female addicted to retail, and well





Man I promise, I'm so self-conscious

That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches

Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy

I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that ver-say-see!

Then I spent four hundred bucks on this

Just to be like, nigga you ain't up on this

And I can't even go to the grocery store

Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team

It seems we living the American dream

But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem

The prettiest people do the ugliest things

For the road to riches and diamond rings

We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us

We trying to buy back our 40 acres

And for that paper, look how low we a stoop

Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe





I say fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em

We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom

We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em

Things we buy to cover up what's inside

Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth

That's why shorty's hollerin' "where the ballers at?"

Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack

And a white man get paid off of all of that

But I ain't even gonna act holier than thou

Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with twenty-five thou

Before I had a house and I'd do it again

Cause I want to be on 106 and Park pushin' a Benz

I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific

I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific

I got a problem with spendin' before I get it

We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it



Now Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life
