I think I'm feeling just a bit vindictive
Niggas been sleep so long I wonder if they even remember who Vic is
Or ever knew, need my revenue, thats with interest
For every song I wrote that didn't go the distance
Could have ran a mile when niggas barely learned to crawl
But it seems as if niggas hate to return your calls
When you ain't balling or got a song or two in rotation I'm taking shots
Fuck the radio, turn it off
Turn me up, I'm in the cut
With a mic and blunt, like wassup
How you doing I'm here to tell you you suck
Your album was ass
Your last tape might have had one or two cuts but thats not enough
Do that sound hateful?
Is that cause i hate you?
Not at all dog just remember who made you yo
Father you niggas style like I birthed you and bathed you
Father forgive em going to church couldn't save you
Do you wanna see what on the hip?
I'll wait, and let you think about it for you slip
And fall into the pit, down deep at the bottom
I think I got em and no one ever heard about him again
His family forgot him I got him a present before I dipped
Flowers for your grave made the track and rapped on that shit
Had your chick and we ran amtrak on that bitch somebody help me I think I'm out of my brain
Winter in the coop got a chicken of snow
In this bitch finessing like I'm hitting a ho
Hitting my line cause i shine, let me get in her clothes
You looking round looking like you never did it b4
You never did it b4
You never did it b4
You never did it b4
You never did it b4
Wait wait wait look who's back
He could trade places with a serial killer but on the track
Tried dancing with the devil i wondered if he could tap
I think I'm sammy davis junior the lead rat in the pack
Pack of raws in my pocket i be smoking till my neck hurt
Always making bricks me and hector
When shit get hectic, have the home lay you out on a stretcher
Stretch work I'm the INNANET AKA the connector
Show me to the plug
Cause i be on them drugs
Some of my niggas in school some of my niggas thugs
Some of my niggas dead broke some of my niggas dead
Red dot on your head right in the middle of the club
She clucking she can't stop
She just want a drop
Don't she know all she ever get bubblegum and some cock
Probably be me and confidants presto, kami de chukwu
You see these drugs make me cuckoo but if you want you can cop
Winter in the coop got a chicken of snow
In this bitch finessing like I'm hitting a ho
Hitting my line cause i shine, let me get in her clothes
You looking round looking like you never did it b4
You never did it b4
You never did it b4
You never did it b4
You never did it b4
I know its likely that you never have done it before
So we won't act like you ever did it before
But do you remember the day when the world around you changes or does it fade in with the rest of what little you know
Is the man in the front the one calling the shots?
Is it someone on the side that you wouldn't have known?
Do the government want me because i know too much and will i know whats bout to happen on the day that I'm gone?
Don't try this at home
Mr. stuntman can i get a dollar for the strip club?
Good day good jesus the birds flock to the way i bounce beat work like it's bass in the kick drum
BOOM
California commercial New York on the one way working my wood wheel like a pimp
On my David Banner Bun B bumping out of the speakers in the blimp
Blowing up like jared after the subway
Pulling up clean you never did it b4
In a magazine you never did it b4
Michael Jordan jeans I never did it b4
Japanese seams you never did it b4
Savemoney niggas yeah they did it b4
Sum, sum sum never did it b4
Doing some shit you never did before and you mad cause you know you never did it b4
