No flex zone, No flex zone

They know better, they know better

No flex zone, No flex zone

They know better, they know better

Won a gold medal

And a gold bezel

I treat it so special

Now your ho jealous

Freak Hoes, got several

They tens or better

I'm a trendsetter

I'm a go-getter



Who ain't waiting on King Push?

Got niggas checking for them new flows

Sold more dope than the old Jigga

Now niggas calling me the new Hov

Let the coupe go, planetarium

Let the roof go like Cesarean

Clear my section nigga, no flexing nigga

Just a hunnid bottles they carrying

Cross the border like I lost a daughter

This foreign nigga, he ain't know better

Him pick and choose where them bullets fly

I lose the plane on this fool nigga

Bought dope with my album budget

Play Cloths was the blueprint

Four million in four seasons

Fuck who care for my fashion sense

Tell a ho come and swim in the money (splash)

Broke niggas just stop at the heel

I could body paint you in them name brands

And put a red bow on the wheels

See I'm just in and out, I call a rent a mouth

Suck the ice out of a bezel

Use my rap persona, fuck baby mommas

Still killin' haters, God bless em'
