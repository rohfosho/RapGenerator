[Intro]

Jay Rock, K. Dot
Watts City finest, and the Hub City threat
LB I see you my nigga
Let's go

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
I'm trying to get cash, quick fast
In the back she's a [?]
With past of Trinidad
[?] plenty hash up in the stash
When you got gangsta black [?] up in the back room
When I walk back, more vicious than wildcats
I would have swallowed that
Nickerson Garden projects gain the profit
Of my lyrical content
Build a monument
Gotta put a clip to your conscience
Watch this, pull up on your block in a stick-shift
Pop six, watch you fall just from the fifth hit
The spliff lit, when I'm high can't I spit sick
First round, number one draft on [?] shit
Got the mind of a chief, the heart of a soldier
With a rifle got a hell of a range like rover
And the fight, got a hell of a strike like vipers
When the gat, got a hell of a aim like snipers

[Hook: Jay Rock and (Kendrick Lamar)]
You wanna act tough
Let's see if you really are, when this gun busts
Oh you say you want war, nigga let's go
Queen of drama, that's on my momma
You don't wanna rumble
Jay Rock I'll put you under
(You wanna act tough
Let me see if you really are, when this gun busts
Oh you say you want war, nigga let's go
Queen of drama, that's on my momma
You don't wanna rumble
K. Dot will put you under)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Since VapoRubs mom's got my Nyquizzle
I was just a scrub now it's all about the bizzles
Trying to make a buck slinging weed and E pizzles
My nigga hit me up [?] that's the stizzle
I'll eat your ass up show you how a bullet fizzle
Get your ass touched one hand on your whizzle
The other on the clutch,  my middle finger up
Shit I'm not giving a fuck
Catch me on Rosecrans and Central leanin' like I'm supposed to
My brain is mental I never stay focused
Plus I'm in the hood with the hood rats and roaches
Caught crack, now served a three-fifth on my culture
[?] these niggas acting like vultures
I ain't [?] homie I swear that your thoughts is bogus
They eyeing on me I'll treat you faggots like [?]
Acting how you act you gone get some out of that holster

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
I'm a Watts [?] soldier nigga
I ain't running, I'ma stand my ground
I'ma keep on gunning
My momma never raised a punk, nigga I ain't a chump
You disrespect you'll be on my thump
Ghetto kill, make you lift up
You don't wanna get struck
Like a match, got a back
That'll break a shit [?]
I attack with a Mac, that'll tear your shit up
Now the paramedics gotta come and make that pick up
Dog, I hit your block in a pick-up
Jay Rock I'm me, a lion, a man, a [?]
I do it by myself, with a hook and an uppercut
Doctor got a six, what, nigga are you real or what
I'm a little guy but I'm tough
I hit hard then I'm natural
You a dead man when my gat bust
If you running nigga better run a little faster
These bullets like [?] oh yeah they'll catch ya

[Hook]
