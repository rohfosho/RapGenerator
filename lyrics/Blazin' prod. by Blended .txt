Ain't no way I can't make it I would die before I ever let 'em take it

Nigga this is my life my story my pain my glory put your lighters up for me I'm blazin'

My teacher told me I ain't ever gon' make it wasn’t handed out shit had to take it

Nigga this is my life my story my pain my glory put ya lighters up for me I'm blazin



Don’t give a fuck about critics they can suck on my di-dick tell 'em I'm breakin' they rules

Doing this shit on my own so I guess now that I'm crown I got the duty to kill it

Turn this shit up in yo iPod feel it when niggas is locked up doin' digits

Pushin they way from they Civic hope that that you never forget it

I got you, you my brother forever where you are put your faith in me I'm shining

You can wish upon a star promise I won't let you down promise I'm gon' put it down

Promise I'm gonna rep my city everytime I'm outta town

I know a lot of niggas hate especially when I'm not around

But when I see 'em in they face I know they ain't gon make a sound

That’s enough of what you know about stories of the heart

How 'bout when a baby's mother sees a family ripped apart

The judge done threw away the key, he was trying to feed his son

There's only two things you can be: That’s dead, or dumb and with a gun

There's niggas dying every day it’s the Chi Town home of the gun shots

Where niggas try to look like Al Capone in they mug shots

City where the weather gets warm and the blood drops

Shot a shorty on his way home from the bus stop

Some one tell me when it ends lost my mind I lost my friends

All that I can think to rap about is candy-coated Benz diamonds shinin' in my chain

Ice gleamin' in my ring parasites inside my brain up in the club and I make it rain

Seein ghosts when I fall asleep - life is a game and it plays for keeps

Drippin' away and they say you weak - voice of the dead if they even speak

Sometimes I wonder what they say

Would you stand and listen to that shit or would you run away

Is you really safe up in your crib or is you one away the strike will hit you any day

Minutes movin' slow I pray I make it through the month of May

Summers commin round too fast

We still trying to get our head together of the last

When they took my nigga wish woulda seen him fore he died

We ain't no bitches but when we heard that shit you know we cried

Ain't that shit crazy, how just one moment can change me from my life

Had or dreams if I was dead wonder what that shit be like

Wonder if niggas would cry wonder if they know my name

Wonder if they think I'm happy, wonder if they know my pain

Wonder if they think I'm lame cause I never had a hit

Wonder if they talk about me then forget that I exist

For the kids that I'mma bring into this world, this is my apology

Your pops is headed for wrong, don't father me

And for the end of this song I solemnly

Swear you niggas can't stand side by side with me

This ain't rap, it's highway robbery

And I brought Chuck and Jay Dee for the ride with me

I own this shit, Chicago's my property

Savemoney standin, no toppin me, nigga



Ain't no way I can't make it I would die before I ever let em take it

Nigga this is my life my story my pain my glory put ya lighters up for me I'm blazin

My teacher told me I ain't ever gon make it, wasn’t handed out shit, had to take it

Nigga this is my life my story my pain my glory put ya lighters up for me I'm blazin
