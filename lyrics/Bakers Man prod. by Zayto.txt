Hit 'em with that sack, uh oh!, fumble

Little nigga smokin' mid, give that pack back to your uncle



I'm the baker's man, I'm the baker's man, I'm the baker's man

Egg beater in sight, (Whip) put it in my hand (skuuuurt)

I'm the baker's man, (skuuuurt) I'm the baker's man, (skuuuurt) I'm the baker's man

Egg beater in sight, (Whip) put it in my hand (skuuuurt)

I'm the baker's man, (skuuuurt) I'm the baker's man, (skuuuurt) I'm the baker's man



Quavo, Quavo

Playing with pies wit no eyes Steve Wonder (Stevie!)

In the huddle calling plays just like Christian Ponder (touchdown!)

Hit 'em with that sack, uh-oh, fumble! (fumble!)

Little nigga smokin' mid, give that pack back to your uncle (mids!)

Got a bad bitch, yeah, she asian like Kitana (she bad!)

Got a scope on the sniper rifle, I see the anaconda (I see 'em!)

Talk to Scooter in Dekalb ,  Quavo, he said "you a road runner"

Free my nigga Offset, ASAP, so a young nigga can get back to the money





Egg beater my left, Pyrex pot my right

Baking soda on the shelf, beat that pot like Winky Wright

Ever since my daddy left, Mama taught me "son do right"

50 niggas to my left, 50 niggas to my right

50 chickens come a day, 50 chickens come a night

When I whip my work today, They gone find yo ass tonight

All my niggas on go, you know they gone smash on sight

That shit you rap and talk 'bout, nigga, you know thats my life
