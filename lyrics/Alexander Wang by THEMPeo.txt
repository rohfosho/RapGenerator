We can go to London or Japan holding hands in the sand

Baby tell me what you think bout that

You can be my one I be your two, peas in a coupe

Baby tell me what you think bout that

Girl what would you say if you and I, change the seasons on the fly

Baby tell me what you think bout that

Ain't nobody tryna fall in love, girl you think too much

Baby tell me what you think



She's sore from chasing

For me to call her back, my schedules packed

Can you imagine that?

But you can find me on the (INNANET)

But tell me what you think bout that



Tell me what you think, thinking or rather drinking

Pour you a more morsel watch the momentum start sinking

Windows, binking linking my key in your ignition

Got a fit like it was written like no pen need for no inking

Gems I Jada Pinkett ring bring Will up to the Willow tree

Ass out lie your head rest it on the pillow sleep

Why don't you bring a friend make it a tandem trilogy

Three the hard way, heart beating in the hard way

You caught me looking, caught you slippin' I guess we even

I find it odd, but simultaneously intriguing

Why don't you tell me what you need? I got it

But first you gotta tell me what you think about it baby

Tell me what you...



They say cut my Dealings, fuck yo feelings

I gotta do, What  I gotta do an all, yeah

They say cut my dealings, fuck ya feelings

I gotta do, What I gotta do and all, yeah

Right before the sunlight

Hit em in the twilight

Deeper than a zeitgeist

She only want the money(x11)



There's two joints on the hour, every hour of the day

My heart is left in pages, I got no time waste no no, no no

Every hour every minute, every second I'm awake

I'm just tryna pay my rent, tryna find my way

If it ain't no way in this world, to come easy no sir

You gotta good girl, better take that chance

You gotta good man, do the best you can

That's just real

That's just real

That's just real

That's just real
