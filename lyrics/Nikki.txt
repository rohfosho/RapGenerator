I can feel you in my lungs, feel you in my veins

Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain

I tried some others but man they just not as good as you

Going crazy cause I only feel this good with you

Maybe I’m just not as strong as I once was

When we’re together lately I don’t even feel a buzz

I’m addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs

Nikki baby I love you but now I gotta go

Cause in the end what happens you already know

Probably wonder where I been at, I been laying low

But in my mind I’m wondering what I’m paying for

All these other bitches on my dick but I can’t fuck with that

You the only girl I need I gotta have you back

Even though you turn my lungs black

Tell me where you've been jack

Uh, I know this shorty that go by the name Mary

I used to fuck her way back when I didn't know a thing

Skipping school with all my homies on some truancy

But when I ended things with her it was just you and me

Doing me good, that’s what I thought at first

Me and you together swear to god I saw that work

Away from you though man it's just so hard to work

Uh, my heart is hard at work

We been together like ten years, goddamn took me as young man

Everyday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go

What will they write upon my grave?

A free man born as a king, who died as a slave

But everything he gave her was for nothing though

Oh no I can’t fade that shit I gotta let you go

You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas

All this shit you got me doing man it’s outrageous

All I know is I’m living the life I never would

Finally let you go, I thought I never could

Don’t get me wrong, can’t forget the times shared

Seem like everywhere I go, I always know you're there

Tried to run but my legs won’t

I look away but my head don’t

I love it when you’re fresh

I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath

I hate it that I need you, Nikki

But I love it when I feed you, Nikki

I hate that I bleed for you

Uh, I long and I need for you

But I love it when I taste you

Nothing can replace you

I wish I could erase you, you’re everywhere I go

But you’re everywhere I long to be

And all these other people that don’t seem to understand

I’m just a man they always ask what’s wrong with me

Man you’re everything I crave

You’re the only thing I let in that would put me in the grave

I’m a king, you’re my Coretta

But lately I been feeling like a slave for the nicotine



Slave for the

Said I’m a slave for the nicotine

Been a slave for ya

I’m a muthafuckin slave for ya

Slave for the nicotine

Nikki, Nikki slave for ya

I’m a slave for ya Nikki

I’m a muthafuckin slave for ya
