[Verse 1:Bladee]

I'm ending
Everything is Fendi
I'm like water but these girls are like gremlins
Feel empty, My clip feels empty
But I will go anywhere God sends me
Rose water in my face, I'm an angel
10k on arms and my labels
I can't look back at a stranger
I cannot love but I'm faithful

I don't recognize your face but you recognize my name
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
I don't recognize your face but you recognize my name
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
My heart is like a highway
Lamborghini fourteen on the driveway
Die if you violate


[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
See me smokin loud finna leave this earth
I'm in a new dimension like a rebirth
Getting to this money, tell me what's it worth
See me smoking loud, finna leave this earth
2k
3k
Never seen light of the day
For 4k
5k
Just made a fortune on ebay
Leaning can't see straight
Can't remember shit from yesterday
Standing over a cliff off a waterway
Your bitch got my shit on replay
See my face in your display
All this shit sounds cliche
See my face in your display
Follow me like Norway
I get high I fly away
Hangin out the window from a Chevrolet
Reality's still far away
Still far away
Still far away

I don't recognize your face but you recognize my name
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
I don't recognize your face but you recognize my name
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
My heart is like a highway
Lamborghini fourteen on the driveway
Die if you violate

Recognize your face but you recognize my name
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
My heart is like a highway
Lamborghini fourteen on the driveway
Die if you violate
Recognize your face but you recognize my name
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
10k in the flames, give me blood rain
