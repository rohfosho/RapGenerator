Damn, cold world

I never thought I see that day that you’re my old girl

Now I’m stuck here hollering at 'O girl

Got one, got two, three, four girls

Shotgun in the drop made a right

Hut one, hut two, told them niggas take a hike

Then it’s on to the next one, on, on to the next one

Hard to move on when you always regret one



I wonder sometimes

I wonder if I was wrong

Tryna do right by you got me here

Now all I am is alone

Cause her eyes

And those hips

And that (ass)

Don’t compare, at all

And at best, all they do is distract me

But now, deep down, when I face it



All I want is you

All I want is you (now)

All I want is you now

Now that you’re gone, gone, gone



Cause being your friend was killing me softly

Hear voices

Wondering where I went wrong

It was my fault, in the wrong time

I wonder so often, regret gets exhausting



Cause her eyes

And those hips

And that (ass)

Don’t compare, at all

And at best, all they do is distract me

But now, deep down, when I face it





Cause they don't smile or smell like you

No they don't make me laugh or even cook like you

And they don't photograph

Nah, they don't sex like you

Let's face it, I can't replace it

That's why all I want is you now



I hit the club when you left me thinkin' that could heal

Tryna celebrate my Independence Day, Will Smith, baby girl

Who I’m kidding, still sick, real shit

All my new bitches seem to get old real quick

And could it be you everything these plain bitches couldn’t be

Is it a sign from the Lord that I shouldn’t be

Lost in the player way, sorta get old to me

Got me on layaway, girl you gotta a hold on me

I say I’m wrong, you say, "come again"?

Damn, said I was wrong - look don’t rub it in

I got a lot on my mind, gotta flock full of dimes

Like a line full of hoes, look how they comin' in

Just sayin'

You don’t wanna have me then somebody will -- I’m playin'

Weight on my chest like I bodybuild, I’m prayin'

You ain’t content with tryna do your thang

Hey come back baby, boomerang
