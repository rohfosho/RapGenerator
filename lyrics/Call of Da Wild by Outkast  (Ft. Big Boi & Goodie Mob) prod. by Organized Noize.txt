I'll be coming around the ghetto when I come kicking one for the treble
Y'all can't stoop to my level, I'm like the devil or whatever
I'm picking em up and throwing em down like dishes
Call me Kenny Anderson cause I slam the sons of bitches
I ain't bragging, folks dragging me up and down the road
They'll be fucked up when I gets into my calling mode
Then cut the clown up on they ass like Bozo
Oh no, then dance on top of they asses like Jo Jo Dancer
Come Comet, come Dasher, come Prancer
Come niggas with machine guns, I think that is the answer
But the question "Should we take that bullshit from them people?"
I'm making 300 on my SAT yet I am equal
Ain't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous
I've had it up to fo'head of suckas tryin to serve us
To graduate is really becomin a very stressful journey
I feel like a steering wheel, for them is trying to turn me
Into a hate monger, and I'm wishing and I wonder
Damn, will I graduate before I hit the summer
I think not, Officer Friendly tryin to dig up in me
He said I'm half assed and got no future
And so he sent me up the creek and shit
Stroking like hell without no paddle
But niggas is gettin smart, we back on the saddle
No longer, y'all know y'all had us down for some years
It's the call of da wild nigga, uh, there it is
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
As I step up, the stage is empty
No words cause I serve with my Southern dialect, so I get respect
Don't call me T, it's a T thang with a G swang
Let my nuts hang down to the flo' mane
Smoking that dang dang, making mics swang
In my 2-8-0 Z, nobody can see me, cruising down the block
Just like I was a squirrel in a world full of nuts
Damn, I'd probably be mad even if I called Uncle Sam
To bring dough to the Goodie Mo-B
T-Mo, Khujo, Cee-Lo, J and my homie Brandon B
Don't flex, I'm next, I break necks too
Rolling with Outkast, PA, Goodie Mob for the 94
Ha-ha-ha. Yeah, you know what I'm sayin?
Yeah, I'm steady bucking muthafuckas
Not ducking 'em like duck goose, I'm heavily strapped, yeah niggas
Squeezing rhymes like that noose around your neck
You can't hang with this, see ain't no thangs to this
I show no pity so take off because I'm dangerous
I breaks 'em off like I was Beat Street, see I be breaking
Speaking of breaking, break on out or get your life taken, boy
Fucking around with me will get your cabbage cut, your wig split
Simply means I'm bringing the funk with the hollow tips
Playa shit is how I'm kicking it
Coming around the ghetto, victims soft as a tack on a jackass
So fuck it or flip it, I'll still be a playa
Puffy afro with nigga naps off in my hair
Shit, that's simply how I run my shit and that's how it be
That nigga B-I-G B-O-I, that be me, yeek
See I'm a playa, got my struggle on
Thinking about the volume and thickness of my bankroll
You see the cops is in my shit like colon cancer
Even though I never smoke that shit like (right)...yeah
I give a call of da wild to my niggas around the projects
So don't flex or get served with a pop neck shit
OG, original gangsta, not quite
But maybe when I'm locked up, lifting weights, getting swole right
Life's a bitch with a G-string, it's either in your ass or it ain't
So you can see who can really hang
But y'all don't wanna do nothing, y'all can go to hell
Ain't no playas in office cause I'm locked off in a cell
So can you feel me, nigga
Khujo, coming in dope, bring it
I got more problems than the average Joe
So bro don't come 'round me with your flim flam, hot damn
It's a jack, top of the burbs, and my notebook is a bird
K's madness into capping
Throw in a few more logs, so my fire looking through the want ads
And only red hot, desire in your pot is something wicked
But you can't feel it, stick it up your monkey ass
I could let shit ride in the past, now it's time to blast that ass
Shhh... Mr. Knighton take off your hat
Can't even my wear my locs in
Demon eye scoping, oh my, peripheral vision got it
Made you go no holds barred
Decisions, decisions to make, oops, here comes the Goodie Mo crew
And they just might want to battle you
Out with the quickness
The price of living is beginning to be a risky business
Uncaged, Parkay
How do you like the taste of hot butter melting through your biscuits?
This is your brain on drugs, this is your brain...
Dope cut niggas I hang with before there were apartments
In Chappell Forest, it's gettin horrid
The hunted child is on the prowl, yahhh!!!!!
I let out a call to da wild
I let out a call to da wild
