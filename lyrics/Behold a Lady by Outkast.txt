(Andre 3000)

Sophistafunk, aristocats

Distinguished stars, clean up your acts

Pull up your pants, ladies and gents

Please, act like you got some sense

You know what I really wanna know?

Where do all the good girls go

What clubs they hang in?



Behold a lady

I see you standin' on the wall

Clap, clap... you deserve it all (Repeat)

(Ad libs)

Candy-coated unicorns are quite hard to find

The classic lady, a rare breed indeed

Is that make and model discontinued?



(Verse 1)

Today I might snow, tomorrow I'll rain

3000's always changing but you stay the same

And I need that, hey I need that (in my life)

When I feel washed up and inadequate

And throw all my songs away, no matter how mad I get

You make me smile, you make me smile

You make me smile, you make me... (Hoooooooo!)

You're the anchor that holds me down

When my ship is sinking

You won't let me drown and I'm grateful

(Awwaww Awwawwawwawwawwwwawww!)





(Verse 2)

Yo' mama's old fashioned, yo' daddy don't play

You'll always be this lovely

Cause they raised you that way

Hallelujah! Thank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord!

Thank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord!

Thank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord!

You're not extra extra, you're so plain Jane

The ying to my yang, darlin'

You've got that thang and you know it

But yet you don't and that's what's so cool

You don't say too much, but when you do it's profound

In the street you hold your head high

At home you get low down for me

(Can't get no lower, can't get no lower, can't get no lower, yeah!)

Hooo! You're the anchor that holds me down

When my ship is sinking, you won't let me drown (Aaaaaaahh!)

(Ad libs)

Sad, but one day our kids will have to visit museums

To see what a lady looks like

So if you find one, I beg you, hold her tight

If you spot one, good sir, treat her right

This is Benjamin Andre signing off

Thanks a million

Good luck and goodnight
