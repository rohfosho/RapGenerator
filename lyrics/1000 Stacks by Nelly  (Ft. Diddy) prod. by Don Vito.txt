Yeah, hey yo Nelly
Let's do this
At, at, at last I'm literally loungin' Black
Sittin back count double digit thousand stacks
At last I'm literally loungin' Black
Sittin back count double digit thousand stacks
Got a bad bitch with me, she in the Valentino
Half black and Filipino I let her count casinos
Her under apple bottom all Lou and Sean John
A hundred on every arm, hundred more in my charm, tell 'em Puff
Let your mind, let your body and your soul go
It's alright, get your money stacked more dough, tell 'em Puff
Pick a day, get your girl, come and play
You know my motherfuckin' name
You know my motherfuckin' name
How 'bout we hop in the Monte Carlo tomorrow
We'll ice the bottles in the ocean with the goggles
And act like you won the lotto
Lamborghini, Vergato my matchin' on the throttle
My motto is snatch, your motto with my latto is a lot
Insane my game is like James
Kobe or maybe Dwayne Wade
Fresh shades Alexander Mcclain's
Bottles of Rosay, some rockin OJ's, tell 'em Puff
Let your mind, let your body and your soul go
It's alright, get your money stacked more dough, tell 'em Puff
Pick a day, get your girl, come and play
You know my motherfuckin' name
You know my motherfuckin' name
At last I'm literally loungin' Black
Tip back count double digit thousand stacks
At last I'm literally loungin' Black
Tip back count double digit thousand stacks
Tip back count double digit thousand stacks
Tip back count double digit thousand stacks
Tip back, tip back, tip back, tip back, tip back
Count double digit thousand stacks
I kick in the door wavin' the fo fo
All you heard was derrty, don't hurt 'em no more
Well fuck that, I'm takin' my reign back
So take that, so take that, tell 'em Puff
Let your mind, let your body and your soul go
It's alright, get your money stacked more dough, tell 'em Puff
Pick a day, get your girl, come and play, come on
You know my motherfuckin' name
You know my motherfuckin' name
I pull up to the party Bacardi smokin' cigary
With the baddest little shawty
Cause shawty love to get naughty
Dollar after dollar you niggas might wanna holler
I'll cinch your lil doller out, did ya with a comma, hey
Keep time AP shine, we fly only in G5, she's fine
Yep she mine, puttin' the peace high hoppin' for BI
Let your mind, let your body and your soul go
It's alright, get your money stacked more dough, tell 'em Puff
Pick a day, get your girl, come and play
You know my motherfuckin' name
You know my motherfuckin' name
At last I'm literally loungin' Black

We be a flawless all this, tell 'em Puff
Let your mind, let your body and your soul go
It's alright, get your money stacked more dough, tell 'em Puff
Pick a day, get your girl, come and play
You know my motherfuckin' name
You know my motherfuckin' name
Stackin' papers contagious, buildin' paper skyscrapers
Stuntin' outrageous, comin' straight out the matrix
Hustle lil mommy countin' papers my hobby
Throw in up the tachycardia down the streets of Miami
My neck gold, the bling is real gold
It came rolled and made to hang low
And the bank roll is made to stay swoll
You ain't fold more paper than cringold
At last I'm literally loungin' Black
Tip back count double digit thousand stacks
At last I'm literally loungin' Black
Tip back count double digit thousand stacks
Tip back count double digit thousand stacks
