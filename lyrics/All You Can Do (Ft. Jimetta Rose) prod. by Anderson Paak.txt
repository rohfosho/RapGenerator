Happy's not a faucet that'll flow when a handle is turned

I wanna handle my shit, but it hasn't occurred

I need the stamina, keep on like my grandmama

When I'm not on camera I gotta be a man of my word

And be a greater guy, not some thin-as-paper guy

Like the times that Georgie Porgie kissed the girl

And made her cry, saying, see ya later, bye

Shit I say is pretty strange

Coming back for Christmas and we bitch on how the city changed

Fuck it, man, we're changing too, look at what we going through

Mama used to buy me shirts she said that I would grow into

But it's draping on me like an apron or a cape, a great tsunami wave of cotton that I'm caught in that she bought at Ross—I know the cost of it was probably awesome but my style is sorta sloppy

I'll fit it when I blossom like a California Poppy

The tears are freezing on my cheek in Boston out in Copley

And I don't really know why, no I don't really know why



All you can do, is



So pour that liquor out. I never chickened out

But if I got to make a second pick I'd take a different route

But a grip of my decisions pretty Mickey Mouse

I tried to join the 27 Club, they kicked me out

It was like I'm limping into heaven while my dick is out

And there's Amy Winehouse sitting on a cloud and drinking stout

But she spits it out the moment I come gliding in

She's all like, “come on Joplin, who the fuck invited him?!

Hide all of the Heinekens!" No, they don't know my name

My heart is lowkey broken so I'm taking Novocain

And Jimmy Morrison the doors, and Brian Jones, you know, the Stones

Are joking, toking on a roach playing a poker game

I know that I'm a bastard. The walls are alabaster

Jimi plays his Stratocaster jamming out with Kurt Cobain

They're playing Purple Rain, or maybe Purple Haze

And Kurt says, “How the fuck they let this jerk in with his hurtful ways?”

I try to jump and spread my wings like I'm a bird of prey

But I hit the earth and break a mothafucka’s vertebrate (hey)

I guess I'm fucking up the blueprint for success

Woke up in the hospital with Jimi's bootprints on my chest

This recklessness, no common senses

I Kamikaze, there's consequences

I don't condone it, but I did it, I'ma own it

I've been living for the moment gotta go (go!)

Cause
