Jay Rock checking in, you niggas checking out

When I grip the pen, that's how it is when I'm on the mic

I'm the People's Choice

The streets never lie

I paid dues so I'm self made

And if you got something shitty to say

You get slept or slayed

Haters in the shade

They running they mouth

They steady talking till the gun in they mouth

Go ahead and chit chat

That's when you hear the click-clack then its all over

Too late to bleed, squeeze then flee, bleed the streets, bleed the beats

True story

I'm straight gutter, all guts

No glory

You niggas whack with them same raps

Y'all bore me

You're all killers and dealers

With scrilla like Kobe

Cut it out, you rappers papier-mache

K.Lamar my nigga, go ahead and take'em away



I said we don't wanna hear that weak shit no more

My flow China white

Like a sheet in the snow

I go deep in the Bible, I could debate with the pope

And you rappers go down hill

Like a ski on the slope

I been a boat with Papi

But I ain't trying to cop no work

I'm trying to cop me the boat and some more property

I told Rock

"We gotta be more then just a commodity

Make the whole name and entity to infinity"

Y'all want me off the juice, no grenadine

Could stop me from thinking presidential like the scattered brains of Kennedy

After I shot, duck down

So the crowd won't witness me

Now, could somebody locate Mr. Shakur?

And tell these Tupacs, they two shots, away from two blocks

Of being neighbors with the Almighty Lord

I put your best material in, then fast forward

Kendrick, signing off

I'm sure your signature's forged



They say I'm headed to the county and they said it's for a murder

In a zone like a touchdown

No need to be turned down

Catch a fade, mandatory

Walk up in the dorm room just me and my heart

Let it start

Where you from?

I bang back

Start pushing back the rack

So I guess it's time to scrap

Run that, Look

Whooped his ass for an hour

Made his nigga have to drag him in the shower

Survival techniques from the streets don't apply in here

Just barbarious niggas who'll try your fears, ruthless

Little church choir and Hell's fire

And lemme see you sing your ass out of this one

Smashed out a victim

Should've kept push ups in your routine

Eating tuna for your protein

Most niggas turn scary, fags get buried

Snatch a mothafucka's commissary

Dont worry I'm a gangster



Look

First name Herbert

Last name Steven

Don't call it my government

Cause I don't know none of them

As far as rap

I'm running it like I'm getting robbed

Target wasn't quite my target

That's why I quit my job

These niggas better hop on board

When my ship sets sail and I sell a few records

Sipping Guinness and set a a few records

Enough is never enough

I gotta do extra

I gotta go the distance

I gotta prosper, I gotta put my mamacita

In that big casa

I gotta be the

Realest if not the illest to spit a verse

God MC, Pick a church

Hallelujah

Don't let the curly hair fool you

My hair ain't quite wool

And my feet ain't bronze

And it's inadequate thinking I used to run Nazareth

Imagine if this hoodie was a crown of thorns

You wish you had the stamina to go that hard

Get your punchlines up, then maybe we could spar

Your lyrics should make a point, then maybe we could score

Then maybe I could show you how three met-a-four

(Beat runs out)

Metaphorically speaking I'm more indecent

Then papa bear getting distracted enjoying his porridge, peep it

In a war, I rip a warrior to pieces

Make a Domino effect, like I'm delivering pizzas

(Kendrick:"Let him go, let him keep going")

And if that ain't a fact, then neither is Jesus

Black-lipped bastard

Puffing on a pasture

I hit a chick till she holla' like she caught the Holy Ghost

Then I passed her, holy smokes

I bring disaster to every quote

You a Shasta to a Coke

I'm a master

Sensei with a pen raised

Build up bricks, just to break

In the dojo blowing do-do

And to be frank

I'm so hot I make the snow flake

On any day

Ab-Soul, now you know mane
