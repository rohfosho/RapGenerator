Jay Rock, Watts Finest, Top Dawg Entertainment

Nigga finna spit 50 bars of real shit

Goes on in my hood, goes on in your hood too

Look I'm real sure



Let me tell you all about Watts

Two-elevens, One-eighty-sevens, it don't stop

Shit ain't all great for your mama

On top carry lettuce workin' round the clock

You can't have your gat retired

Get caught slippin' and your life expired

Shit, growin' up, all I seen was drug dealin'

So I wanna live the life of a dope dealer

In the kitchen whippin' like Betty Crock

Sittin' in the spot with a gang of rocks

Clientele pumpin' now the spot is poppin'

Gotta shut it down, yeah them narcs is watchin'

Connect call the church said he got some Os

It might be tapped so we use them codes

Hit your high school just to bang the turf

Sockin' out shit, showin' off for hoes

Your girl know you out there makin' a grip

Hood rat bitches wanna sit on your dick

Now this nigga wanna fight you over a bitch

Wonder why niggas lookin' at you funny

Cause you walkin' round with a lot of money

Flossin' too hard so he got jacked

Niggas pull up on the side of him

And put about sixteen shots in him

Two witnesses saw the whole action

Police asked, but they don't know what happened

They know that snitchin' is a death wish

So they kept their mouth closed, they ain't said shit

They live by the code of the streets (what's that)

Never ever talk to police (that's right)

Gangstas on their way to a block party

Stopped at the store, gotta get Bacardi

Now they at the party all sauced up

Lookin' for dirty hoes to toss up

Some killers pull up in a Cutlass

Start bustin, and everybody duckin'

It's tragic when the guns stop spitting

Their lives, an innocent victim

And now he's wrapped up in plastic

His momma gotta shop for a casket

His homies don't know who did it

So they ride round town lettin' everybody feel it

Now another died on the other side

Killer Cali, land of the homicide

All we could do, was pray for them better days

Product of the streets, ghetto made us this way
