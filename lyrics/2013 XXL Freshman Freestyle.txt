See, I’m a motherfucking lyricist, bitches they fearing us

Back in the day they wasn't hearing this, now I’m the one who’s steering this

I’m self-driven, will he kill it? – That’s a lyrical given

New-School style but the 90’s is where my lyrics living

My flow is like another Earth, Second nature

I disintegrate ya’, migrate ya’, then light-saber decapitate ya’

In the beginning they said it was fabricated, as soon as the numbers escalated

But these fuckers just mad that I made it

More chains than when a slave traded check it

I’m under MC’s skin like muscle tissue, what’s the issue?

If you talking shit then Im’a hit you

Grab a pistol then whip you, then dip you in lava, ain’t no one ‘liver

Second I arrive I murder it, no you never heard of it

So sick my lyrics I don’t spit – I regurgitate them

As listeners chronologically study my words, verbatim

Assassinate em’, the second I raid them like five-0

We pull off the heist and flee to Cabo now

I mask emotions like a robbery, cause when it comes to matters of the heart

Women will clog your arteries

Visionary - V’s up – Rattpack

Young Sinatra, Maryland's what I'm reppin'

Conceal the flow behind the image like a murder weapon
