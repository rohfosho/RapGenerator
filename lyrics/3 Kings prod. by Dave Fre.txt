Niggas talking shit when we step up in the club

It's all good 'till you get hit with a slug

Yeah he on the wall, coughing up blood

Should have known not to fuck with us thugs

Catch me in the hood, blowing on bud

Nigga, fuck your dollar man, I'm all about dubs

Catch me in the kitchen, cooking up drugs



I'm all over the stove like pots and pans

Hit the corner with the rock, the Glocks in hand

Rock hold more shells than a taco stand

If I pop, the block hot like a summer jam

Damn, I won't hesitate, to let the pistol whistle

Bullets like many missiles, go straight through your tissue

And your momma yelling, crying sneeze into some tissue

I'm like, damn Rock, you could have worked out the issue

Really hard in the club  without no bodyguards

This where OGs fresh out the penitentiary are

For those who don't know me don't pretend you're hard

Yeah that loud talking shit, that'll get you scarred

Left hook, knock your punk ass on your back

Your head busted, now it looks like the crack of her ass

Then I'm back posting up on the ave

With the homies smoking and joking, counting that cash





I'm like a sound system bump base on the block

Niggas scheming, bulletproof doors on the drop

Well I ain't got a garage, '64 in the lot

In the city of god when they bust at the cops

I stay with a fed, always keep me a bitch

Always holding a crip, always keep me a clip

Yeah, these niggas like  to trip, I'll send them to their destination

To that hot place, you can talk it out with Satan

I'm hot faced, I was blessed with raw game

Bitches fiending for my dick, call me cocaine

In the hood, like tall cans and low daddies

I'm from CA, but some call it killer Cali

Twist up dro, laid back like recliners

Smoking on five, got me higher than airliners







Yeah it's Jay Rock niggas

Straight out the projects, Nickerson Gardens

DeeJay Dave, I see you my nigga

Fat Boy I see you my nigga

That's how we do it here
