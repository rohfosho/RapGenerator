I gave her my heart, she gave me her's too
This exposition, the definition of true
I knew her for years, she knew me too
As if our souls influenced this pursuit
Beginning as children, forgetting we grew
Just an analogy for how the time flew
Inseparable, two peas in a pod
Running through my mind like every two minutes tops
In the back seat, doing what we do in the spot
Hear you "ooo" when I hit the spot, head hit the roof
Young lovers under the moon, it's cool but it's hot
Nails in my back, exhaling on my neck yes
I'm haunted by these memories
And what I thought to be a premonition of a wedding ring was just a dream
So now I'm taking all these drugs to go to sleep; weed and white
Lean and Sprite, hoping God is holding me
I wanna blame her, but I ain't
I wanna touch her but I can't
I still love her, I'm afraid
But her absence disturbs the harmony we made
And I never say I'll never find another girl
Who ain't a freeloader or a renter
But a winner that'll buy me out
Terrace bring the sax in, I'm signing out
(Soul!)
