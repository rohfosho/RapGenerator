Chopper with that hundred round that’s a lay ‘em down
Don’t nobody move, don’t nobody make a sound
All my niggas play with Whitney, that’s that Bobby Brown
I rob in my black tee, hit licks in my black tee
I’m not Gucci, 4-5 long as Shaq’s feet
I'm sippin’ on that mud, I’m not a pig, I’m a squid
Oscar flows in the spot, pull ‘em open, bust your wig
All my niggas keep that sid like Billy the Kid
No drag queen, but we aiming at your wig
All my niggas keep that saw like that movie Saw
Double pump, pistol grip, that’s that sawed off
Take ‘em off for his bails, but we not soft
We get them choppers shipped in straight from Moscow
These diamonds brighter than the light, I’m a fucking moth
Teach a lil’ nigga how to juug, I’m his fuckin’ scout
WWE, yeah, you know my team is raw
If the boss say don’t fuck with you then get lost
If the plug front me bricks then I get it off
Fifty choppers in that Maybach like I’m Ross
I’m posted at BP, serving that gas like QT
Foreign bad bitch she a cutie, call the plug up for a QT
All blue Lambo tookie, Steven Spielberg, I make movies
Me and Thugga Thug just boolin
Strapped with choppers and Uzi's
Got an Asian plug with the sushi, smokin' diesel, call it dully
Don’t front me no set, I’m taking off with it, call me Darren McFadden
You know I wear Prada, you niggas wear nada
I can get you knocked off, that’s a done dada
Tomorrow the Louis, I’m tired of the Truey
But niggas can’t do it so I gotta do it (do it, do it)
