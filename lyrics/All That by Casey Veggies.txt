I pop up on yo' block, pull up on yo street

Girl, first I got your number, then I got under them sheets

Then I hopped on top of these beats, I ain't been home in weeks

Yeah, I know you tryna eat, but, nigga, I'm tryna feast, so I gotta go

We got hoes, we got drinks, we got all that

She gon' go, she don't think, she do all that

Wasn't feelin' lil mama, had to fall back

Hit my phone, ain't talk no dope, I don't call back

Write these verses so, player, we read verses in Isaiah

Baby ain't even gotta state it, she know that I'm a smooth operator

Baby talk too much and I don't like that

Gotta leave tomorrow and I ain't book my flight yet

Sometimes, no matter what you do, they forget about all that

But I know they gon' remember me, cause a boy all that

I'm ballin', she want it, I get it, I get it

I'm plugged in, got friends that, spend millions



We got hoes, we got drinks, we got all that

She gon' go, she don't think, she do all that

They don't think we from the streets, but I'm bout all that

I came up from the bottom, I do all that

We got hoes, we got drinks, we got all that

She gon' go, she don't think, she do all that

They don't know we from the streets, but I'm bout all that

I came up from the bottom, I do all that



All of these bitches be jockin', all of these niggas keep hatin'

I get Jacksons, Grants, and Franklins so we call that changin' faces

Stuntin' off in the Bugatti, drive so fast you think I'm racing

My nigga, this weed so strong, I'm gone, you might think I laced it

Ballin', bitch, I thought you knew

If you niggas had my paper, you'd be ballin' too

Teach a nigga how to stunt, I should start a school

All I do is press a button just to start the coupe

Swimmin' in so many women, I lost count

Once they give me that pussy, homie, I dog 'em out

If you ain't talkin' bout money then what you talkin' about?

If they say money talks, then my dollars shout

Popsicles on my chain, ice cubes on my wrist

Snow cones on my fingers, yo' bitch on my dick

Street nigga, still have a mill up in my shoe box

Old school, still keep a stash in my tube socks

Kush, all up in my rollin' papers got me coughin' like a cancer patient

Countin' cash like a calculator, OG still gettin' dome like activator, all that





I fuck bitches, I get money, I do all that

Niggas want me to impress 'em, they can fall back

I'd be trippin' if I told you I was all rap

I got stocks, I got blocks, nigga, hold that

Wal-Mart prices on the roll backs

Cheap shit, nigga, we don't know that

Expensive, designer, we spendin', we spendin'

I'm ballin', got friends that's, Egyptian

And I'm out for that payback

Got a couple niggas that stay strapped, yeah

New school had a nigga trippin'

But my old bitch helped me get my soul back, yeah

I started off in a Sonata, then I went and got me a Range

Then I went and got me a Beamer, now a few of my homies do the same

Nigga we don't care about chains, I can shine in white T

That's pro'ly why yo' bitch like me

Low key she wanna be my wifey, I'm thinkin' that she might be

Show her shit you never show her

She wanna get high I insert with a quarter

We playin' games, you out of order

Thirsty nigga need water, you know you can't afford her, yeah





She got blunts, I got papers, we got all that

We gon' smoke, we gon' fuck, we did all that

Homies trippin' and we trippin', we with all that

Pint of act, double cups, we got all that

Lil bruh fought his case, just gave him all day

Baby Buddha in there too, he got all day

Time goes by, puffin' on shake

Just to keep him high, watch the time waste

L.A. niggas in Atlanta strip clubs

Smoking good, eating good, I just fell in love

Lil bitch told the homie she don't have sex

We already fucked, you ain't gotta flex
