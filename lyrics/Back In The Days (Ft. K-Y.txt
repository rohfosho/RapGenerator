Yeah, just thinking back, (mmmmmm)
Just thinking, yeah
Back in the days when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But could somebody tell me, where did them days go?
(Back in the days, back in the)
Tell me, where did them days go?
(Back in the days, Back in the days)
Smoking on a blunt and I'm reminiscing
When I was just a young nigga with dreams and big wishes
Just a little guppy, swimming with big fishes
I was like seven, my favorite channel eleven
Couldn't wait to see them Simpsons, a cartoon fanatic
My parents on drugs, who didn't have habits?
But ain't nobody perfect on this earth surface
You live then you die, that's life's purpose
But I miss them good times, been through the worsest
But I gotta thank God for blessing us
I ain't never had nothing, first day of school
My excuse, my momma waiting for a check to come
And I ain't had no gear, but I ain't shed one tear
Because my momma never raised a punk, yeah
But through the midst of it all I miss them old days
Granny cooking gumbo, my daddy bumping his ol-days
Back in the days when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But can somebody tell me (where did them days go)
Where did they go? Where did they?
(Tell me, where did them days go?)
Where did they go?
(Tell me, where did them days go?)
Where did they go?
Back in the days when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But can somebody tell me (where did them days go)
Where did they go? Where did they?
(Tell me, where did them days go?)
Where did they go?
(Tell me, where did them days go?)
Where did they go?
Big head little nigga, running with my click
On the train tracks, throwing rocks and shit
Flipping on pissy mattresses, in the back of the jam
Big homie's trafficking, who didn't have to sin?
To put some food on the table to feed they family
Cause being broke is no joke, it brings insanity
How I know? I seen it everyday
Smoke is up and down the block, tripping, gone off the yay
Crack pipes, bullet shells, in the sand where we play
Dead body in the street, seen it every other day
Sittin' in the house, now I'm watching the box
Wrote my first rap, man I thought I was Pac
Back in 9-4, when the bricks was live
Some hoods was at peace, some hoods broke ties
But through the midst of it all I miss them old days
Granny cooking gumbo, my daddy bumping his ol-days
I was a little young buck soaking up the game
Wondering how the fuck I'm gonna make it, out here, no-o-o
I could be like the niggas I grew up with
On the block serving crack rocks, all that shit, but noooo, no not me
And even though I got real killas that live on yo street
I don't be sounding the alarm when I got beef
I got me
(Cause if it's going down muthafucka)
I got me
And this is for my momma
Made a nigga strong, "Go hard when there's drama,"
My aunties and all my cousins
Relatives, all my loved ones this is for you!
