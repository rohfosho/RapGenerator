You want to know

Then I'll try

To tell you how it is

There

Isn't ever much

Cracking the coconut hoping to get me to open wide

Now

If you want to know

Then all you have to do is ask me

I don't have a thing to hide

I walk in the office of my orthodontist and without a warning

My jawbone is already pried

And honestly, I've never lied

Second to none

If I pucker my lips and I lickem I'm looking to kick an impeccable pun

I don't kick it like Beckham

I kick it like Beckham a decade ago when I run my mouth

You think I'm a megalo-maniac

A lout?

I'll be begging to differ

Try sticking a flute or a piccolo

Up a particular part of your pecker

But I'll let you pick it though

I'm out

I'll chuck up a deuce-- a bigalow

And be cracking a Michelob

And I give a toast

And I trickle a bit in the gutter for all of my bigger bros

And I walk it out

Now

If you want to know

Then all you have to do is ask me

Not a thing to hide

I'm trying to be totally open like all the time

Now

If you want to know

Now

Then all you have to do is ask me

Not a thing to hide

Now

Not one damn thing

Now

Not one damn thing

And I'm glad I got all of these ears around

Me

Not one damn thing

And I'm glad I got all of these ears around
