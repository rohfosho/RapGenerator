Uhh uhh uhh

You ready B? Let's go get 'em



Look for me! Young, B

Cruisin down the Westside Highway

Doing what we like to do, our way

Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason

All of my dates been blind dates

But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me

I'm mashing the gas, she's grabbing the wheel, it's trippy how hard

She rides with me - the new Bobby and Whitney

Only time we don't speak is during Sex and the City

She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over

She's right back to being my soldier

Cause mami's a rider, and I'm a roller

Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?

What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder

When I'm off track, mami is keepin me focused

So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be

The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B





The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you loving

With the same respect that you treat the one that you humping

That ain't 'bout nothing - if ever you mad about something

It won't be that; oh no it won't be that

I don't be at, places where we comfy at

With no be-atch; oh no you won't see that

And no, I ain't perfect - nobody walkin this earth's surface is

But girlfriend, work with the kid

I keep you working that Hermes Birkin bag

Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens

600 drops, Hercedes Benz

The only time you wear Burberry to swim

And I don't have to worry, only worry is him

She do anything necessary for him

And I do anything necessary for her

So don't let the necessary occur, yep!





(Talk to 'em B)

If I was your girlfriend

I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you

Even if that somebody was me

Yeah-hee (break it down for 'em, B)

Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be

And so I put this on my life

Nobody or nothing will ever come between us

And I promise I'll give my life

And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend

Put this on my life

The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in

I promise I'll give my life

And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
