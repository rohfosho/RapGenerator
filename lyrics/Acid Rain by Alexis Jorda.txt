It ain’t hard to tell, I excel and prevail
Young niggas raising hell but talk well
Make sales, and managed to evade jail
Blessed on the road to success, wasn't paid well
But here we are, breathing, fuck demons
Never get caught sleeping, I’d rather be caught dreaming
Now me and my niggas be flying across seas
Laughing at the days we used to rack tall T’s
Now we rock shows up in London, wondering
How they even heard of me
Never did occur to me if I get to the top one day
Lotta niggas gonna be sending shots some way
Could it be the words that I jot then say
Across the bed, hoes you never got complain
One day, though, some day is on
One day you’re here, next day you’re gone
Wake up with the fear of living for another day
Tell myself that it’s nothing that I can’t take
Your strength is the sickness I can’t hide
I try to be invisible to him
Make no noise, tip toe through everything
Hell’s fury feeds the fear inside
It’s like acid rain in a hurricane
Might hear your call to bring you cover
It’s a crown of thorns leaving me torn
Might hear your call to bring you cover
I made choices that I cannot live with
I regret not choosing over him
I’m suffocating in this life
Don’t know if I can survive this weather
And you turn up with your arms and umbrella
I send a farewell tonight
My life could be a movie, dawg; let me write the script
It would be something truly never read like a crypt
Little nigga with clothes full of hoes like a pimp
Far from a flower but I rose like a blimp
Now who we gonna cast for the roles in this flick?
Only bad hoes getting chose for the tricks
Who gonna play the lead, though? Will Smith? Maybe
Second thought, fuck it, can't nobody ever play me
Yo, some day is on, one day you’re here, next day you’re gone
Yo, some day is on, one day you’re here, next day you’re gone
Yo, some day is on, one day you’re here, next day you’re gone
Yo, some day is on, one day you’re here, next day you’re gone
One day you’re here, next day you’re gone
I know the risk has come, I know I can run into your arms
I know you’ll come to save me from harm
