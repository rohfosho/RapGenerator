He's a Maniac. Maniac

All in all in all in all in all

(laughs)

All in all ...



All star navigate blood-bath circuit...circuit

All city wolf pack'll arm all servants...service

All and all cut from similar scissors and surgeons...circus

All machines murder if the herders merked nervous...nervous

In around em all in all out pedigree centipede maladjusted curb purge all binge

All out a machine with cog misalignment - shooting star

Eight-ball all alien appendage out his cookie jar





These are not his office hours

What he coughs is mandatory

Three obnoxious hawks and howlers

Roughly buff the categories

Twenty broad shoulders, all sober, all circuit-prowler

And matador electric tongue stung at sergeant markers sour

Who the fuck, needle Jux property

Chickens've all been

Soaked under the water works, all other birds evolve with me

Duck and a phoenix and rout behemoth architecture out the jungle

Where my condors can reorganize their numbers



All day pool party and journalism Zion

And bazooka flash the grin she decorate the closest Nikon

Bazooka flash the molars decorate the close Minoltas

Canon Hasselblad quicker than Polaroid exposures





If open voltage leads all funny play tip the fuddy duddy fuck long come on

Get your stolen drums on

All of y'alls all dumb out pimping art like a whore's box

And all of y'alls all couldn't rap your way out of a card-board box

Get high now, solidify your zone

And let the medallion of spiritual accomplishments keep growing





Oh snagglepussy getting pushy mushing dirt up in the gears like

Aesop Rock is all ears





All in together now

Dear lord holler at me

All i know is hell is down and god don't cover doctoral fees

No phases all over civility like greased-up baby groins

But I will not stand for the flipping of a weighted coin





Suck we are the new now colony all mangy-like

Radar for the crazy oink

Keep winning for later joint



All for one and one for all and justice for all and fiddlin' with dead mice

Only toughens the claws, my all systems go will be perceiving dystopian civil war

Steal a meal to the last tickle in your jaw

All clammy all-state labor day committee folk

Got busy worker ants intimidate the sitting duck



And that my good people is my piece

All in one manual

There's only one in all the shaking hands you do



I'll trade the pound for pennies opus, I don't need it

Fuck now look y'all heed it
