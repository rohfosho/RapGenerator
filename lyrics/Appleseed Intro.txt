[Verse 1]
APPLESEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED!
Yeah, yeah, I recall the
First time I bumped heads with my head led to a dead bargain, a
"Thanks for nothin, lowlife" and a start of, "Beg my pardon,"
When a dust mite harbored spite it barely
Dents the cicada phase, blades averted
Decorate the backs of freedom fighters, servants pick those
Steeples higher, man the loose cannons
"Pannin for gold?" Nah panning for chance to land in camps branded with
"Push" stamped on their hand lets
Push, let's push up through the
Now, let's evoke a vow of
Zipped lips clipped to my peaking
Brow, I'm sleeping now, I seen immaculate hearts blemished
Under the mass of genie bottle hostages who wish that a
Third to her broken promises
Black spot of Gotham, fragile
Castle and master passageway
Even the innocent captives bleed
Bleed appleseed apple seed, leave me with a breeding
Hassle factor's feet
Pin the tail on the village idiot
Turn giddy click stern greet a burn it basics laid with the
Modes of neurotic nitpicking
Patrons and their pseudo potent
Patronage, ahh mood of the moment
Gloated in splendor of its
Greatness and I'm hella swamped
Truly moody in my days makeshift awakeness
Act as if apathy's been your best friend since the bonding
I'll one up you with love letters from despondency
Honestly appleseed..
Yeah!
