[Intro: Ab-Soul]
Wicked as Aleister Crowley, you niggas know﻿ me

[Bridge: Jhene Aiko]
Kick your game, spit your flow
Can't fuck with this Top Dawg shit though

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Wish I could see out of Selassie' eye
Maybe my sovereignty would still be mine
If all the gangs in the world unified
We'd stand a chance against the military tonight

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Babylon, Babylon
Out my window all I see is Babylon
On the news all I see is Babylon
And all niggas do is just babble on
Money and hoes, want money and hoes
If I sold dope, I'd have plenty of flows
If I was from the projects like Jay Rock
I woulda more than likely slang rocks
All my life I done been around Crips and Bloods
Pimps and thugs (Just to name a few)
I do drugs, momma say it's in my blood
But she don't know what the fuck I've been through
To creep through the back door
The typical black boy in the good old USA
Before I pushed rhymes like weight
I used to wanna play for the NBA
Hey...
Fuck I'm doing talking 'bout pineal gland
Ancient ways of Sumerians
Ain't nothing wrong with a righteous man
Damn...
This why I had to write this man
For my niggas on the corner, selling water
To somebody's daughter, fluctuating prices man
I ain't got no gavel
I ain't tryna fight nobody battle
I just wanna be free
I ain't tryna be nobody's chattel

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
(Extra pills, extra pills)
Them AK clips stay extra peeled
Smoking on some of that extra kill
Purple Urkel, that Jaleel
I put that on everythang
If we could link up every gang
And niggas is willing to bear the pain
We'd put the White House lights out today
Okay-kay-kay
We mobbing like we the black KKK
Don't forget my a.k.a. Mayday
Pee on your Ph. D. or your AA
Hey, Dear Barack
I know you just a puppet but I'm giving you props
You lying to the public like it ain't nothing
And I just love it, I hope it don't stop
I don't give a damn, nigga bang that block
I don't give a fuck, nigga bang that Glock
I seen an image of Hitler in the picture
When the twin towers dropped
Peep the concept
You've got progress, you've got congress
We protest in hopes they confess
Just proceed on your conquest
I ain't got no gavel
I ain't finna fight nobody battle
I just wanna be free
I ain't finna be nobody's chattel

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
(Extra pills, extra pills)
Nose candy rain like Soul 4 Real
My baby needs some enfamil
So bags get stuffed like Oprah grill
Pull around, come back, oh, for real?
Top blew off, loafers in teal
Get lined up like homeless meals
Feeling if he know how being homeless feels?
Okay-kay-kay
Don't try to stop it, get in my way
You'll get stomped like a Broadway play
AK melee make ya obey, okay?
Feel my pain
Going insane, I'm ashamed
Cause I ain't got shit but an EBT card
From a fiend that owe me and it's in her daughter name
How the fuck is they 'posed to eat?
How the fuck am I 'posed to eat?
Got a nigga in the streets, no health care
Tryna slang weed just to put shoes on his feet
So fuck you, you don't give a fuck about me
Can't get a job if they drug test me
Got a nigga stressed depressed
Got a feeling in his chest and the world's stripped of happiness
I ain't got no gavel
I ain't tryna fight nobody battle
I just wanna be free
I ain't finna be nobody's shadow
