We don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie talkies
We don't need your coughing when offing the morning coffee
No, we don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie-talkies
We just want our hermitry to stay and our coffee to go
And the last shall be
First to immerse in the pass out heat
Face in the mud where the moxie melt
'Till he woke up drowning in tchotchke hell
More in a cave with a torch on the wall
Than a window arrangement of porcelain dolls
On a brand new day, saw what he saw
Property owners who crawl to the mall
With a bad toupee and a face like he author the law
Pace like he mourning a loss
Right hand on a can of worms
Left full of gold he will trade for turf, I mean
That's ok, you got to answer to you at the end of the volatile day
But a model of mercy and might, no way
Marionette who will clap and obey
Dude, look, all that noise
Call that flight of the water boys
Meet and greet and they all slap five
Cheek to cheek when they colonize
And a grown-ass man shall abide as he wish
Walk that path with a dime and a stick
Walk that path with a diamond and wine
Walk that path to the firing line
Just walk, pay no mind
To the new recruit with the play-doh spine
Let's be friends from opposite ends
Wave to the kid don't hop on the fence
Play to the radius far and away
Orbit wide don't park in his space
One little martyr who talk in his face
Make one little Weathermen sharpen the blades
And the last shall be
First to the curb with the mad cow meat
Face in the bars of a regular cell
When he woke up high in collectible hell
Boom town kid who was taught by the binge
That a man who expire with the most shit win
That's warpy american nonsense penned by the rich
Not a routine friend in a pinch
Still not used to the stench
How it throws off otherwise lucid events
In the case the afraid observe
I got a Pro-Keds box full of layman's terms, it goes
Hey, peace, pray for the plagued
Major relief and capacious rains
But just cuz I don't want to war with you
It don't mean go warm up the barbecue
I'm like pardon you, sawed off limit
My high noon is a quick little minute
I don't wanna spend it sitting with a critic
Who simply isn't going to ever really get it
This HQ is alive and alone
No driveway no sign of a home
No dial tone, no line for the phone
No world's tiniest violin song
And I might just lie to them all, lie in the morgue
With a deep breath hiding and bored
Fighting a smile, highly annoyed
When the timing is right I will rise and record
Call for the monster beats and Blockhead got
Animal drums like he's doctor teeth
It goes red light green light 1 2 3
One large coffee, fuck you, peace
T-A-K-E-N-O-P-R-I-S-O-N-E-R-S
T-A-K-E-N-O-P-R-I-S-O-N-E-R-S
T-A-K-E-N-O-P-R-I-S-O-N-E-R-S
T-A-K-E-N-O-P-R-I-S-O-N-E-R-S
T-A-K-E-N-O-P-R-I-S-O-N-E-R-S
I crawled down to the basement
When the weather got cold
Like a lost lamb returning to the fold
And when the outside world recedes from view
It's just a year's supply of make-up
And memories of you
1967 Colt 45, holding back the vampires
Keeping me alive
There's an envelope with some cash in it
Out by the front door
This is what they make you take the medication for
