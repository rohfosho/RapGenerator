Acid Rap!
I don't even talk to them on the phone again
Leave in the AM, on the road again
So bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke again
I gotta smoke again, I got shit to do
Who smokin in my car?, it's that nigga Chano
AKA Mr. Bennett AK Tony Montano
I've got some folks in low end I got some folks in c-note
AK hundred dinero, you ever seen Casino?
I just got back with 'Bino I got a bitch but she know
Her friends done did the Dino, that's that Chicago lingo
Flamin' hots with Cheese, and a kiwi Mistic
My dick won't even call her, cause she left all that lipstick
Niggas be on dirt, hat's why I stay on petty
I know that bangers jam, that's why my hands stay ready
Flip the candy yum, that's the fucking bombest
Lean all on the square, that's a fuckin' rhombus
Who's sneaking in the club?, that's that young Sir Rapper
Un-saran wrap the purple, wrap that blunt under after
Smoke all out the window, cops could eat a dick
If you ain't the hitter, you just might be the lick
Flame on, flame on I'm your bitch's ringtone
She like when I rap raps, but better when I sing songs
No Drake, but I get my Trey on killin' in the hood like Trayvon
Shoppin' like I got a coupon, savin' like I got a cape on
Cookin' crack in my apron, dressed like a nigga had 8 proms
Tell shorty I may change and I made it and I napalm
Trippy shit to watch drugs while on the clock
Acid on the face that's a work of art
Soulo ho ho twerk somethin', throw it back like you tryna hurt somethin'
I'm so def, I ain't ever heard nothin', my name herb, take herb, smoke herb (say word?)
How 'bout you? No dap, but I'll take a pound or two
No doubt like Gwen Stefani's group, let me put my mouth where you potty, boo
(IGH!)
Them niggas pissed, need potty training, they movement shit, that's a potty train
She ain't left yet, but she probably came we kicked it then I score, soccer game
She was a phony goalie, I got great aim though, don't insult me
I'll give it to ya straight, this is what she told me
My name Solo cause I'm the one and only
She only got you as a nigga on the side, that's a nigga on the side of a side bitch, homie
Then we got out a Dodge, like them Dukes of Hazzard
Music and tabs of Lucy, take your chance with this rapper
