Fuck niggas gon' multiply

'Fore the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply

'Fore the real niggas live, fuck niggas won't multiply

Fuck niggas won't multiply, fuck niggas won't multiply

Igh, igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh



Yeah nigga, it's your boy Juicy J

Man, you gotta watch out for these old backstabbin', broke ass, you know what I'm sayin'? Jealous hatin' ass niggas out here man, you know what I'm sayin'?

Man these niggas ain't no real niggas man, know what I'm sayin'?

Man these niggas be smilin' in your face



Back in the buildin', sold crack in the livin' room

Niggas toe-tagged, sold gats for a livin'

Doo rag, keep a red or blue flag in the denim

One you be with be the one to shoot at ya in a minute

Come to Harlem if you never seen Baghdad

First place I seen a nigga sell crack at

Where the hustlers don't sleep, take cat naps

Shorty with the shotty limpin' like he got a bad back, bad back

Even in my will, keep it real, thuggin' in my field

'Til the day I peel, keep it trill, anything I feel

Youngins trained to kill, aimin', bangin' steel and slangin' krill

She shake it all for Satan just to paint her nails and pay her bills

I ain't really fuckin' with that Been Trill

Swear them niggas booty like Tip Drill

Nah I ain't really into throwin' shots

But these mothafuckas better give me my props, word to Pac

We're the reason that these niggas gettin' throwed

Reason why you niggas wearin' gold

Jail pose in the pictures, prayin' fingers to your nose

I remember, if Pimp was alive he'd tell these hoes and these niggas



Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I peel

Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I peel

Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I peel

Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I...

When the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply

When the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply

When all the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply

But if the real niggas live, fuck niggas won't multiply



I'm the original Balmain badass, nigga

I'm the original Margiela madman, in the words of A$AP Yams

Smack the shit out a nigga in these skinny pants, feel me?

Don't get it fucked up, nigga, we been jiggy, been pretty

Still tell a bitch suck my dick, swag swag nigga



Fuck with a nigga like me, RIP my nigga Pimp C

HBA shit is weak, you can keep that

Shit, I might fuck around and bring the Jeep back

No doors on it, flexin' with the seat back

B-Boy with the G pack, might fuck around and bring the mink back

Word to Big Boi and 3 Stacks, nigga

If you deaf bring the beat back, nigga

Fuck with a nigga like me, RIP my nigga Pimp C

HBA shit is weak, you can keep that

I'm a trend setter, you ain't even peep that

Where the hoes, where the weed, where the cheese at?

Fuck the FCC, tell 'em bleep that

(We ain't no fashion killas nigga, we fashionable killas

Ya'll got Flacko)





3, 6, suck a nigga dick no foreplay

All day, boomin' out the trap through the hallway

Slow up, Pretty Flacko Jodye

Tell these fuck niggas how you been

You can freshen our minds, niggas talk down every now and then

On the style, gettin' styled 9 times out of 10

(Y'all got Flacko fucked up)



I'm the motherfuckin' Lord of this fashion shit

Don't I deserve just to brag a bit?

Set the blueprint, fuck your two cents

Number 1 stunner, ask Tumblr if I'm accurate

My motherfuckin' swag is immaculate

Plus I got enough style just to mack your bitch

I think back to when pockets packin lint

It's like a nigga got rich on accident

Now back to Pimp

Bitches lie, killers never lie

Triggers on the side by side, bet I'm down to ride

Prosper said let's ride to the sky, call it catastrophic

We don't ever die, we just multiply, bitch



Fake ass niggas, you know what I'm sayin', these niggas be out here talkin' 'bout they a street nigga and shit, man niggas be gettin' extorted like a mothafucka out here man, you know what I'm sayin'
