It ain't sinnin' if you winnin'

I want anarchy at shows

I want bitches showin' titties

I want blood and broken bones

Trippin' off that chemical

LSD you better know

This is just a steppin' stone

Mosh pits and heavy smoke



Mosh pits heavy smoke

Mosh, mosh, mosh

Mosh pits heavy smoke

Mosh, mosh, mosh



Let's go

Sarge Ayu, shooting star blue moon

Young red god reppin' that coast

We comin' up, the opposition fucked

Get em' to the morgue they gon' croak

I hate when a nigga ain't wit' it

Come stand front stage at one of our shows

Better get back before you get attacked by the pack of the wolves

My immaculate souls

In with the mosh pit you better clear space

Fuck with the gods we live up the place

Music and trancing your chromosome flame

We're lighting the way, cause an eternal change

Chemical balance, mix acid with cane

OG only blow potent on the stage



Never slipped but i tripped already

If i'm fucking her she sucked dick already

Wild boy ain't shit you could tell me

Meechavelli, tattoos on belly

And i got a case of Old English with me

And i keep that fire stored when i roll with sticky

Clockwork Indigo, nigga we mobbin'

Fuck is your problem, go get your mosh in



Know that i'm with it, i handle my business

I'm moshing with niggas that hold up my image

I mosh with my killas, the beast coast offenders

The spliff got me gone at the least til November

The indigo union, the movement is now

Them clockwork individuale

That's Issa, Arc, and Meech the dark

Juice got the heart, AK'll spark that



Now hold up, hold up, you don't do drugs?

(You used that line before!)

Bitch so what?

Igniting my spliff, let's fight in the pit

I walk on the crowd like i'm christ in this bitch

Bounce, bounce, come on, bounce

Anybody in the crowd with an half an ounce

I got LSD, shrooms, DMT

Too you don't smoke weed, cool more for me



Been a 1000 days since i been sober

But my karma so clean i dont need no love

Puff trees and act up, and throw them hands up

Elevated clan stay lifted on mad skunk

If you got asthma to the wall like plasma

Cause we don't give a fuck you and your ass get crushed

Clockwork anthem, just mosh and have fun

Come out and see the gang

You better bring your love



Nigga who that, Juicy come through

Clockwork clique shit, yeah this ain't the pope

Yes i slit your throat

Bars wicked like government officials with pistols

Itching with a Beretta to get ya

Shoot you, then get off, they miss you

The world is twisted so fuck the rules

My mind constricted with mushrooms

Clockwork bitch, this us dude

Bloody, gory, niggas ain't worth it

Smoke up, I started, I'm rolling again

Nickname Black Jesus, I'm born to win

You gon' learn today

My niggas ball to win

Sweat drip-drip off the microphone

Zombie baked bitch, Juicy be on
