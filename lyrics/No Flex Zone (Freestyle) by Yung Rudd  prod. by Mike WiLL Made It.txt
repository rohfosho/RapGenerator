No Flex Zone, No Flex Zone
Rudder coming in and I'm damn fly
Couple spliffs in, damn high
Only have one life, be a good sport
Take two pull until your eyes're Shanghai
You know, Chinese low
Puff pass til we get irie, yo
Cannabis cannabis, my rhymes them attached to the joints like Siamese so
Allyuh know de scene already
Running this rap shit
Now Rudder is ratchet
With Hardy on the team, we're shelling
Lyrics immaculate
Hope allyuh could catch it
Like cricketers playin T-20... uh
Metaphors I got many... uh
Thought y'all knew like Delhi... uh
Killin y'all dreams like Freddy... uh
On the boulevard by Jenny's... uh
With a best thing from foreign
Feeling my T&T Spirit, no ferry... Uh
Giving me forward, that means that I'm scoring
Like Germans in the semis... uh
Have "Nah Boy" as her text tone
I'm not the one to play with, like a stush girl it's a no flex zone
God damn
Going ham
Like Trinis on christmas
Give me the spliff cuz
Grams
No jam
Hit up the push
Give me the kush
Smoking, toking
Bretheren I'm floating
Don't give an F B, your girl I be poking
Like you're Mecasmi, you only be coasting
You're really a donkey dan, fuss you be toting
Grow nuts in that scrotum
And when you do, make like your Texas and hold 'em
Like me cause I'm up at the top of the totem
You know that I'm running this shit' Ato Boldon
Damn
It's we they say that up damn next
Gonna be the top or I'll be damn vexed
But I'm spitting hard so you can't flex
Paxx 'Em
