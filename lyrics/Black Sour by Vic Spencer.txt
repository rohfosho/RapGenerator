(Verse 1 Vic Spencer)

I body beats and go to jail

Write some bars in a cell

Record upon my release

In a fucking wishing well

Bet you hear the echo then

If not

You are estrogen

A physical specimen

Checking in the regiment

How long can I tread water

Peddling inifity

Fucked a few bad hoes that went to holy trinity

Fucked em some more when they graduated kennedy

King of the city colleges

Teaching chemisty

The mission is to stop these niggas from reppin the GO wrong

I am out of this world, into the ozone

Hotter than volcano

Grab ammo

Jerk it like porno

Tear up clavicles and torsos

Skeet on your baby momma polo

Thats real horse power

In rush hour I get shit crackin like sunflower

Seeds best believe that the flow clam chowder

Dumped on the new eddie bauer left to sour



Hook (Michael Anthony)

I keep my head on the future

I manifest in the form of a cloud rain down exhale and fill up the room

Black Sour x3



(Verse 2 Kami de Chukwu)



They say its vicious how he flip six bitches

To mix mixtures

And cook dinners

While he proceed to spit venom

With flows strong enough to constrict boas

Snakes in the grass

Stay low if you dont know em

Stay close

That be word to my family

Save money mission that be that till my last day

A band of brothers start assembling an army

Feeling sorry for them pockets cuz we savin all that money

Change it up

Change it up

It be the legion of doom

With a couple plots cooked some rocks from the moon

Had em fiendin out till he started servin em tunes

In a world of cartoons he stay bumpin that doom

Its fantastic

How he brewed magic

Sad faces too tragic

When the sound base static

To the sound wave addicts

So he took a crack at it

Dabbled in the dark forces

Salem level black magic



(Verse 3 Vic Mensa)



Black Sour

Black Power

Reading Huey Newton thinking the world is ours

Powers

That define us

Time us by the hour

Mama why they tryna confine us

They throw us in with piranhas

They want me gone and I know it

Im manifesting a blessing just to get high when im lowest

Whats ya life like

Is it bright lights

And screams for the night life

Is it wonders and mysteries?

Is there anybody here I need somebody to believe in

Im lost in how it looks but I know looks can be deceiving

I keep hearing people comments on what I should have been achieving

Congratulations on your failures and your fuck ups and your tweaking

Thought you would have made it big

Now you the biggest disappointment

Could have made it for us all but all you did was just avoid it

Why you running boy

Running from the same thing that you running for

Smoked a hundred blunts and smoke a hundred (BLACKSOUR)more
