Gangrene, I'm slumped and I can't see shit

Rolling up the ganja, the crew is a slant lean

Medusas and camps team fit (Shrooms and a doob)

Mix it and proceed to hallucinate, Lucifer playing Wii-Fit

With a wide stance and a lance, think I'm just tripping off the

Sounds of psy-trance in my pants pronounced Dickies

Not showing you really want it, I'm taking your shit (Give me that!)

We open the shutters with no piggy back

Rough, raspy with flows that's buck nasty

Just last week hit a dip with plump ass cheeks

Creep dissing but you do not step upon the lad's sneaks

No refunds, nigga, you chose this stuff actually





Smoke in front of customers, get 'em accustomed to it

Lush, fluent in the language of philosophy

Dangerous like popping 360s in some soccer cleats

He with it, only living for the days where I sway like the rocking beams

Grades up, got a J tucked in the pocket tee

See, all of these niggas praise us, watch them jock the steeze

I'm in a daze counting broccoli

Before you ship projects, make sure the crate is stamped Polynesia



Yes, it is I, the accomplice of the samurai

Sick flows, hoes, and weed, and still camera-shy

And we throw in bananas when them hammers fly

Learn to use my grammar with my manners so I will be fine

Later on, please don't hit my line if you isn't tryn'

I got work, less than what it's worth, please respect the grind

Decapitating lines, capture all the minds

Could give 'em all of the science, but they still committing crimes

We rookies to the game, testing waters

Be on this local shit, but still I'm trying to take it farther

?, plugged in with his Asian father

Comme ? in Japan whipping base, he make it harder

Your team full of bench players, we a bunch of starters

And Nick will dunk on your players regardless, we fucking heartless

Threw Monty a alley, he lost it, he fucking lost it

Been stuck in this hideous process, I can't be processed

But no one got belief in me, I see the tree

Should I take the fruit or should I leave? Is it the key?

Bitch, I'm high as hell and moving keys, that's by the kilo

Man with delivery, come spin with me

Me and Watson got that killer beat, Ms. Hilary

Take a trip into your memory and you will see

I ain't lying I'm done trying, producer named Psymun

All these rappers got a mouth but when they see us stay silent

K-Breeze stay styling, we ain't scared of violence, this shit

Timeless, hotter than saunas with prima donnas and your highness

The way I'm grinding, you would think I wrote the finest

Nu Age taking off, and that's a promise, in the future, you won't find us
