You know these hoes wishy washy

They'll fuck your partner

Take all of your guala, take your wallet

You know these hoes wishy washy

They hop in my bed, they can't wait to open their legs

They walk in the mall, they can't wait to spend all my bread

Wishy washy, wishy washy, these hoes wishy washy

Wishy washy, these hoes wishy washy

Wishy washy, I can not trust them

Wishy washy, I can not love them

You gotta watch them, these hoes wishy washy



Let me tell you a story

'Bout this lil' bitch named Tamara

She'll let you smash for sure today

And then smash your partner tomorrow

She'll ask you can you take care of her

That'll cost you 'bout a couple hundred dollars

Everybody know lil' mama on go

Everybody call her hundred gobbler

Got hoes on hoes like a roster

Is it because of my posture?

But I know it's cause a nigga's dollars

She got a baby, no, I'm not the father

She too wishy washy, she'll go in your pocket

And break your wallet, and you know she got it

But I got the knowledge to go tell her stop it

And she shake like an 8 hit a corner pocket

You can not play me

You know you're too wishy washy

Kick her out the house politely

We noticed you was too excited

No we not going for it, no we not going

You're too wishy washy lil' bitch and you know it

Ain't got time for a kid, the lil' bitch at the front door





These hoes wishy washy

Ain't no doubt about it

Quick to put your finger in a young nigga's wallet

And I know you fuckin' my partner

Quick to fuck a nigga for a couple hunna

High class pimpin' these niggas, she got the formula

Suckin' my anaconda, got the flower aroma

And on my mama I'm not fuckin' these bitches without a condom

Wishy washy

Cut these bitches off like hibachi

I'm fuckin' her and her whole posse

If you wanna fuck her then you gotta pay deposit

She givin' up her pussy for the profit

Her mama keep beggin' her to stop it

She really wanna be on red carpets

These bitches ain't shit, it's in the Bible

Talkin' 'bout you got a baby in your stomach

These bitches are funny

They're tryna take a nigga's money

I don't got no feelings for no bitches, I'm numbing

Up to par, my swag from London

These bitches bad, ain't worth nothin'

I'm just sayin', I can see your plan

You wanna get married to a rich man





I can't fuck with you bitches, you wishy washy

Neiman Marcus shoppin', she want me to spoil her rotten

But I know that she's plottin' mama said don't trust nobody

This bitch is a vegetarian, all she want is broccoli

I told her if she knew better, she would prolly do better

That Rolex is a Sky-Dweller, got gold all on my Margielas

Pullin' up in a Bentley, no Mr. Bentley

She askin' me where my umbrella

Fox fur, put on my mink, chinchilla

Flawless diamonds, it's gon' be a cold winter, burr, burr

Don't wanna fuck you, lil' mama, I just want head

These bitches, they can't wait to open their legs

But soon as she pull in my driveway

Pull up to my front door, she got the panties in her hand

She know how to work the pots and pans

She watchin' me like I'm on demand

She the bomb, Osama Bin (Osama Bin Laden!)
