Say what I'm supposed to say this time

Okay I got it, shit

I done came down hold up

I say roll up, she say my dick nasty

I wrap it with a fruit roll up

My nigga I'm a soldier

I'm lil mama's soldier

Riding for all my dogs

Riding for all my niggas I'm dirty just like a hog

I got to cameras in my face I got the paparazzi

Niggas looking at me jewels hanging like a fucking Nazi

Uh, how you do it how you rap on that auto tune

How you rap and do that auto tune

I'm that fucking dude

I do this shit I got money up all up in my pockets

Money in my roof I'm from the H-town like a fucking rocket

I should have used my last flow but now I'm getting better

I'm getting cheddar I ain't a rat dog you master Shredder

I'm more D'angelo when I be singing on hoes

When I be singing it's that young nigga, straight Kirko

Coming from the east, of the motherfucking streets

I got hoes like dogs see them hoes on my leash

Yeah she sucking on me like a flea but I don't have a flea

I got a fleece on when it's cold nigga that's for me

Yeah coming down styling yeah I'm coming down wildin

Could have put me in a jungle do this shit for my uncle

Do this shit for my brother and this shit for my sister

God damn, do my thing man

Do my thing uh



Ha, ha ha

I said god, please forgive our sins

Cause what we're about to say might go against the good book

It's a shame what rappers got to do

Ha, for a good look

How you heard a nigga that decepted all his flows

He do it for the fame and I do it for the cause

I didn't ask for it nigga nigga I was chose

Put a lot up in my blunt and them blessings in the sky

I put my mama first and keep a smile up on her eyes

So call me what you want but a fuck nigga I'll never be

I went to hustling in the streets to XXL with my G's bitch

Ha



My enemies know whats popping, you get it they know what's popping

Heat, get it when shots get knocking reloaded and taking shots

And he loaded and taking shots at least hollow man be my top 10

Spray a goon and a goblin in shirt maroon

Put my white tee a crip musician what I might be

Ammunition more than likely

More hollow shells in the lobby

Left his ass to an IV

And left my feeling to a body

As mommy cried from the hommie

See it clear as Dasani I got the streets all behind me

Got these coppers behind me this copper flying then find him

Sirens gon need a siren the paramedics done got him

Seen whats clear fore they clear

See a gangsta when I see a mirror

Where you from? then hell appears

K bullet hit like a spear

Hit the chest than exit your rear

Like "damn I never jam"

He smoke quick as a gram

You niggas soft as a lamb

We G ride in Sedans

We blam soon as you glance

Money murder our plans

Kill your home and your fam

Rata-tatat-tata-tatat it's like that

Uh yeah
