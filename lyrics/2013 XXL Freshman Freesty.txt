The sum of all fears is a and billion and three
More of a reason why everybody's scared of me
Cause ain't nobody sayin' nothin' rare to me
Just comedy, or a parody
You could suck two dicks for comparin' me
To any rapper that fits in this category
Section 80's baby, pray you follow me home
See my habits, my contradictions and my systems of control
Top Dawg Entertainment
They saying we saviours like this ain't dope we slanging, hope
You can get a feel for the skill like the famous coach
Ain't need a ring on my finger to be a champion
You can't be on my level, you'd get expired
We was racing on unicycles, I wouldn't be the one tired
Soulo Ho3, well known from Del Amo to SoHo ho
Don't stop, roll more dro till you comatose
My egg's fried, probably why I like omelets the most
Lonnie wanted me to vote, I love Lonnie but no
See I ain't into politics and shit, I got my own pole
What's the difference between a person and a human?
One of 'em is free, the other one is stupid
And I'm caught in between the two, which direction are you in?
Put a "Yo" in front of "universe" and tell me what do you get?
