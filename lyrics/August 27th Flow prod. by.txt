Play me some pimpin' mane
Yea, Stay Trippy in stores August 27th
Fuck with me, yuh
(*Bang*)
Man fuck these hate ass niggas
I'm a rich ass nigga still getting richer
Got kush all up in my swisher
A extendo hang from my pistol
Got Gucci sneakers on my feet
Freaky bitches all in my suite
Bad bitches in my hot tub
And bad bitch in between the sheets
26'ers on my oldschool
Born up and I'm ridin' hot
Runnin' up with the bullshit
So machine-a will start a fire
Better know I got that money
Better know I keep that burner
Niggas tryin' to take my cake
Beat that bitch nigga like Ike Turner
BITCH!
Ain't no money coming like your own money
I'm never coming off short
I got that long money
I'm counting up that paper
Before I leave the house
Just got that new Mercedes
That ain't even out yet
Roll up while I'm drivin'
Yea ho I'm just vibing
Big house all pimped out
Back yard look like an island
Boss nigga I get paid
Bring yo' bitch out to my place
I'mma fuck that bitch today
Tommorow yo' bitch my maid nigga
Ye-ye-ye ho, dirty ass nigga
Tommorow yo' bitch my maid nigga
Tommorow yo' bitch my maid nigga
I'mma fuck that bitch today nigga
Tommorow yo' bitch my maid nigga
(Ye, ye, ye ho, ye ho) (x3)
Still reppin' all niggas
August 27th Stay Trippa
August 27th, ya dig!
Stay Trippy, ho ass nigga
Pimp shit getting lots of head
In my drop head
Tell them haters drop dead
I don't fuck with beef because I got bread
Cause I got some goons
With me not scared
Fill yo' ass up with hot lead
Hit the club with some hoes
Like you ain't just got shot dead
All this money on my rolly, could have bought a Benz
I’mma wake up in the morning, ain’t gonna ball again
And the money’s my alarm clock
And I’m known to carry more guns than a pawn shop, nigga!
August 27th, Stay Trippy, yea...
