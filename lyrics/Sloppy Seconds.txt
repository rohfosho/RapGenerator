Fuck you if you love a car for its paint job

Love you if you love a car for the road trips

Show me the miles and your arms and the pink scar

Where the doctor had to pull out all the bone chips

Cause you were pressing on the gas just a bit hard

Right in the moment where the road curved a bit sharp

And when you woke up

Somebody was unclipping your seat belt

And pulling you from the open window of your flipped car



Cold pizza, tie-dye shirts

Broken hearts, give'm here, give'm here

Hand me downs, give me give me leftovers

Give me give me sloppy seconds

Give em here, give em here

I don't care where you've been

How many miles, I still love you (2x)



Show me someone who says they got no baggage

I'll show you somebody whose got no story

Nothing gory means no glory, but baby please don't bore me

We won't know until we get there

The who, or the what, or the when where

My favorite sweater was a present that I got a couple presidents ago

And I promised that I would rock it till it's thread bare

Bet on it

Every single person gotta couple skeletons

So pretty soon, in this room

It'll just be me and you when we clear out all the elephants

Me and you and the elements



We all have our pitfalls

Beer's flat, the cabs have been called

And everybody and their momma can hear the drama that's happening behind these thin walls



Cold pizza

Tie-dye shirts (tie-dye shirts)

Broken hearts

Give'm here, give'm here

Hand me downs (hand me downs)

Leftovers (leftovers)

Sloppy seconds

Give'm here, give'm here



I don't care where you've been

How many miles, I still love you (2x)



I dont care (cold pizza)

Where you've been (tie-dye shirts)

How many (broken hearts) miles, I still love you

I dont care (hand me downs)

Where you've been (left overs)

How many (sloppy seconds) miles, I still love you



My pattern with women isn't a flattering image

But I don't want to run away because I said so

I dont want to be the guy to hide all of my flaws

And I'll be giving you the side of me that I don't let show

Everything in fashion

That has ever happened

Always coming crashing down

Better let go

But in a couple years it will be retro

You rock Marc Ecko

My shirts have the gecko

Cuz in the past man, I was hopeless

But now's when my little cousins look the dopest

(whoop whoop)

Fuck the fashion po-po

Have a stale doughnut, I don't need no tips

Fuck a five second rule

That's a plan I never understood

It's September in my kitchen in a Christmas sweater

Sipping cold coffee on the phone with damaged goods



And there is not a single place that I would rather be

I'm fucked up just like you are, and you're fucked up just like me



Cold pizza (cold pizza)

Tie-dye shirts (tie-dye shirts)

Broken hearts

Give'm here, Give'm here

Hand me downs (oh hand me downs)

Give me give me leftovers (leftovers)

Give me give me sloppy seconds

Give'm here give'm here



I don't care where you've been

How many miles, I still love you (2x)



I dont care (cold pizza)

Where you've been (tie-dye shirts)

How many (broken hearts) miles, I still love you

I dont care (hand me downs)

Where you've been (left overs)

How many (sloppy seconds) miles, I still love you
