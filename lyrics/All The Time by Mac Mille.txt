[Intro]

Uh, Uh. Yeah yeah, uh

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
When you finally gettin' paid, everything be feelin' great
Went from diggin' in the crates, to chillin', gettin' faded
Don't live a normal life, but I hope you can relate
And it's hard to see it right, blowing smoke in all your faces
Coolin' at the crib, can't believe it's where I live
Can't believe it's what I'm doing, can't believe I got this big
Can't believe this what I'm driving, can't believe this what I'm wearin'
Yeah the Benz is pretty cool, but I need a McLaren
When they see me out in public, dap me up, say what's good
Don't need to take a picture, it's better if you look
Going for your Queen, give a fuck about a rook
Papa was a player; took some pages from his book

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time
[X4]

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
To the seven telly and it's peanut butter, jelly
Chillin' with da homies, smoking weed and watching Belly
Headin' to the deli, rollin' with some Pirelli's
Now I'm gettin' money like 2001 Nelly
They wanna take my photo, my finger in my nose though
Dutch's from the Cogos
Playin' water polo
Above the ozone, young Han Soulo
You start rapping and I'm like no no no no no, no
Do you get it? Tell me can you feel it
I'm only gonna get a bottle from you if you steal it
Time on this money, money all the time
Lookin at me funny cause your money in decline

[Hook]

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
Big bank won't throw loans or free things
Stack that dough, go get yo paypuh!
Dividends could devastate ya
Make it right don't let it play yeah
Big bank won't throw loans or free things
Stack that dough, go get yo paypuh!
Dividends could devastate ya

Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time
Spendin' time on this money, I get money all the time
All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time
All the...
