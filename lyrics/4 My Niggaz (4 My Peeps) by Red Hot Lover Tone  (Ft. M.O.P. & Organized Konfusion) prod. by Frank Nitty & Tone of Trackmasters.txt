For all my motherfucking niggas, word to Herb we get stupider

Running mad circles round your crew like Jupiter

Oops, I mean Saturn, rappers sadden

Cause I'm mad in the pad and suckers wish they had and

I'm bagging the bitches grabbing, my pockets fatten

Like Madden, then I just lamp like Aladdin

So what you gonna do when I come through your town

With mad niggas who love being locked down

Facing convictions, throwing conniptions

I got more bitches than them royal Egyptians

Step to this mic you're a goner

Cause Red Hot Lover's right on like Cynthia Horner

I better warn ya, you'll get your ass kicked, I'm blasted

That's it, I drop it like a clumsy black bastard

I'm getting figures from my rap diggers

Got my shit-kickers, yo, this is for my niggas



Introducing the black bastard from Bedrock

Guaranteed to make your head rock, tote Glocks

Drop cops that mistake me for Rodney

Strictly head shots, I knock the twist out your dreadlocks

Who got the props? Biggie

Who got the Glock? Biggie

But who is he?

You can't get my description, you need a prescription

Two doses of the ferocious

Feel the weight when I'm crushing 'em, bumrushing 'em

Stuffing 'em, I put the pressure on em, hon

Lord a mercy, Jesus Christ

He's just nice, he just sliced like a Ginsu

Look what I been through, the Brooklyn streets

The obese thug nigga from the East

The black nine, hard to find motherfucker

After the rhyme press rewind, motherfucker

Strictly for my niggas



I nod my head cause the flavor hovers over

Universal Soldier of Hip Hop, somebody shoulda told ya

40 Projects Southside Jamaica Queens, please don't

Sleep I walk the unforbidden where most MC's won't

Check it, if you ever felt sceptic about my intellect, it's

Hectic, I'm like antiseptic on record

Disinfectant show wrecker, sound seizing your sector

Local areas, across seas, even in Rome and Mecca

I'm known, Prince, organizing with the Red Hot Lover

And the bad brother Biggie Smalls from another

Planet called Brooklyn, hey good looking

Do you like your hot chocolate after dark - uh

I'm scared to get you hooked in

You might have to seek medical attention, the unforgettable type

Representing my niggas rocking, rocking the mic right

Harcore M.O.P. type shit

Peace to my other half and my niggas doing bids



I used to start more shit than high school bullies

I was doing my thing since my nigga Boom Bang used to steal cars from police

I break niggas up like referees

Put em on point, back out my joint and making 'em move like refugees

Li'l Fame rep is Brooklyn bound

Still niggas that fuck around'll catch a beatdown from Brownsville

I'm going all out the western way

Old school or new school, I beat your ass like it's freshmen's day



For y'all wannabe emcees F-A-G's

You gon' fuck around and make that nigga Bill squeeze

I'm representing for all mines with nines

Hardcore's in town, my niggas that get down

A hill figure on the trigger (true)

Your Crooklyn sounds got pounds and break through

Stopped puffing the lye, still sipping the brew

So I be on cruise when you snooze and then you lose



It's Li'l Fame, motherfucker (slap, Little Mallet)

We bring you pain, motherfucker (slap, Little Mallet)

Cos I'm rugged no gimmick

And I'm taking rappers out like Uptown niggas be doing bitches on 125th and Lennox

I represent M.O.P., niggas that act stuck up they get stuck up

Or even fucked the fuck up

Peace to Tone, yo pass that blunt, hit this slicker

This is for my niggas



Yo hold me down, Fame (I got the pound)

Danze with the truck shit, that I don't give a fuck shit

I'm hitting niggas where it hurt, I do work

(I'm packing my blue steel) so you niggas hit the dirt

The M.O.P. we been busting out for days

Taking 'em through a phase, going out in a blaze

I'm out jail still holding my steel

(Bucka) Bow! Wargames representing this build

Brownsville, for my niggas



Word, and Red Hot Lover Tone tossing suckers like salad

Incredible vocabulary coming from the Brooklyn freak

Peace to Fulton Street

Knuckleheads'll get wrecked with the quick mic-check

My intellect shows no respect for suckers who slept

In fact my rap style attracts

I have your girl looking for me in broad daylight

With a flashlight, pillow, and mattress on her back

Cause yo shit is wack

So here goes the No-Doze, I'm putting it on foes who oppose

Coming off like porno pantihose

Peace to Organized Konfusion and B.I.G

The M.O.P., from R-e-d

For all my motherfucking niggas, word to Herb we get stupider
