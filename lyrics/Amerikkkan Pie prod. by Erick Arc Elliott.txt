I am redesigning the mind of the masses

That fear a black man with tattoos and bandanas

But when a white man wear tattoos and bandanas

And joins a bike gang it's all cool with the balance

Hate my black flesh, bet you're mad that I came up

You cannot change, rearrange my chemical make-up

Pigmentation, annunaki blood

Who just wanted to make ya

Astral project plug outta the matrix, you fake fucks plagiarists

I make a whore drop drugs with my cranium

Telepathy, host with the most

You can't find a better beast

Better off dead, I sever off heads

Ever since I blew up niggas think I got bread

So they got their hands out, they gone get their palms read

Red from all they bloodshed



Load it up my nigga, bang bang

Cook that rock nigga, slang 'caine

Point your finger, play the blame game

Fuck it dog it's the American way

Get high my nigga, maintain

Tell lies, chase fame

Cause if they could they would still hang

Trust me dog it's the American way



Music my own drug, distributed through the people

Niggas will never change unless you thinkin' you need to

We were built to destroy, home of the unemployed

We callin' it rap, while you callin' it noise

So evacuate your homes, radios never play my favorite song

Miss America would never be black, no use in tellin' me that

Everybody could coincide, it could never be that

Good riddance to the realest, but you gotta feel us

Gettin' cash every day, twistin' flame, hurtin' feelings

Stereotype, never marry a wife

Another block nigga making music, maybe you right

Most definitely and you questioning me

If the world fucked up the exception is me

The government love guns till they aimed at you

Ain't no tellin what I might do for the red white and the blue





Oh shit, Oh Lord

Here we go again finna get these packs off

Repetitive sedative, got a fetish for fetishes

An American menace, I'm manifesting my businesses

Realest as realest gets, terror the terrorists

If you put your hands out I'mma crush your fingertips

Fuck Bloomberg, that man absurd

Throw him in the trunk right up on the curb

Hop out mash out leave his ass thurr

Niggas talk shit but I don't fear words

Better off dead, prepare for the worse

Been slaved since the my first damn days on this earth

Fuck social security and fuck homeland security

9/11 biggest fraud in history

And all you rappers ain't god damn shit to me

Getting fucked by a label

Fame chasing bitch chasing lonely ass nigga probably

Go and snitch you ain't going to face it

In debt to the red white and blue

Your government lies so who the fuck is you
