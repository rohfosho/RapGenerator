Mansion for the bachelors

Flippin' all these hoes like a spatula

Nah, you know I don't like no camera (nah!)

Your bitch she like an animal attackin' us

She won't leave me 'lone, she love the bachelor

Migos, young rich nigga, we some bachelors

Bachelors, bachelor, bachelors, ooh bachelor

Bachelors, bachelors, uh, bachelors, Migos some bachelors



Quavo, I am a bachelor

Look at the way I'm dabbin' like a pastor (I'm dabbin' ain't it)

I am a bachelor

Rockin' the shows, smashin' hoes right after

You know I'm a bachelor

Got your bitches workin', calling me master

Came from the bottom and now I got guala

Turn the page, my nigga, we on the next chapter

Trapper turned rapper

Graduated, now a nigga's a bachelor

Flippin' your ho like a spatula

Don't get me wrong, I still whip up with spatulas

Your ho was creeping like tarantulas

Migos we don't like the cameras

We find out that we can make millions with it

So we started flexin' like bachelors

Came from stashing money in the ceilin'

Young niggas why don't you wanna be bachelors?

Came from kicking doors, juugin' plug for the bows

And now we taking trips to Africa, Africa

Niggas say that they are entrepreneurs

I don't see the millions that you pursuin'

Statistics in black and white, what is you doin'?

Top the charts every time we drop a new one





Migos, we the bachelors, we pull up in tarantulas

Whippin' the dope, with the Terminator break the spatula

Get the pack and then I wrap it up and then I bag it up

If I catch a mug I'll charge a private jet to Canada

Promoters ain't got my money, I'm shootin' up your manager

Fuck it my nigga, we shootin' innocent bystanders

My niggas on top of the mountain, no Grand Canyon

Pull up with choppas and make a nigga call the ambulance

Drinkin' on Actavis and I'm rollin' up cannabis

Hoes runnin' 'round the lobby geekin' up and their panties wet

I had a cuban link and Rolex before the rap shit

I just adapt to the trap cause that's my habitat

I'm in the corner catchin' the work like a cornerback

Runnin' to the money, my nigga, think I'm a running back

Niggas still trappin' quarters, make 'em give their quarter back

Forty pointers in my Breitling, oh that's what you lookin' at?





Pull up to the mansion, 50 story, hundred rooms

She lookin' at my diamond solution, that ain't no shrooms

Hold a nigga rest and beat his head in with a broom

Got the bird that be flyin' like caterpillars out cocoons

Penthouse elevator, it'll elevate yah

Pull up in the Bentley, think you seen a fuckin' Jeeper Creeper

Got that 9 on my waist like a two-way beeper

Got that price on your head, nigga like a alopecia

I'm a bachelor, I got a oil factory in Africa

Trapper turned rapper then rapper turned into a massacre

Then beat a nigga, stomp a nigga, I will not account

From the beginning these bitches, they wasn't shit, they ate the apple

I had a warrant with the sack, the police tried to make a tackle

Green Bay with the green, vacuum seal it, I'm a Packer

Just because you rap about it, you are not a trapper

Just because you got a milli, you are not a bachelor
