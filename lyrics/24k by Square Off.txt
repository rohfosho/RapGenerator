All gold, all gold



Dreaming nigga sleepin, I'm out for the weekend

Fuck it, all the lean on me, Morgan Freeman

Gold chain, gold roll

If she swallow let me know

Acid tripping, skinny dippin

Pillsbury, get the dough

Then I'm on another show

? got the smoke

Riding down Crenshaw

Young niggas winnin bro

King all of my niggas

Queen all of my bitches

Spend it all on these riches

When I'm done you gon miss us

My bitch bad Kim K

In Japan like a sense

They gon do what Trip say

Cause Trips banking all this k

These niggas fake, I'm real

Like my nigga Paul Wall grill

No ice, my niggas chill

I wonder how Pimp C feel

OG

All my niggas don told me

Gold Chain, Purple lean, Kobe

Hope these niggas don't od

Fucked a bitch she don't know me

After I nut, get up and leave

My black ?, thats OC

We run the world like Bush peeps



Throw the pot, turn the stove, my niggas dipped in all gold

All gold, all gold, all gold

Minus tolks, on them toes

Paint them bitches all gold, all gold, all gold



Loud all in that zip Still ridin round with that grip

I said why I'm sellin my buckle Gold crowns all round our wrists

I be standing high on these couches looking down on all these snitches

Middle finger to the law dicking down these niggas bitches

Fuck your ho your bitch is bad

All her toes be painted gold plus Birkin bags

Cause when she rockin, pussy pop, that ass fat

I seen her owner with a bottle, you can have it back

Skinny nigga, pockets brawlin, I got them racks

Time to wash my niggas money like a laundromat

You know where to find me at

Full grown, Jesus piece on the cuban links

Lord knows, we got the streets

Got the keys, game locked, door closed

Court cases I fought those

Bases loaded, I toss Os

Range Rover, don't Porshe drove

Got 4 hoes, fuck 4 clothes

I'm in Atlanta, like Georgia Dome be uptown like, Fordham Road

When I'm dead and gone, its over tell em all gold my torso, oh!





Oh, picture me gold, now would you hang it

If it's perfect picture, let me tell you would ya frame it

Fuck that shit it's plated, never outdated

I'm 24 on 24 karats but my chain is

Fuck that shit I'm famous, got bitches out the anus

No homo rose gold will be my latest

I bought it for my latest, my newest bitch is Danish

She don't speak my language

But I bet she know what my name is
