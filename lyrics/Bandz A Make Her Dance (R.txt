(Strippers)
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks popping pussies, I’m just popping bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin’, and they ain’t using hands
Short hair, like Nia Long, loose ones, she don’t need a loan
Start twerking when she hear her song, stripper pole her income
We get trippy and then some. So nasty when she rollin’
She put that ass up in my hands, I remote control it (Yeah ho)
She give me dome when the roof gone, at the K.O.D. she leave with me
She got friends, bring three. I got drugs, I got drinks
Bend it over, Juicy J gon' poke it like wet paint
You say no to ratchet pussy, Juicy J can't
Racks everywhere, they showin' racks, I'm throwing racks
In the V.I.P, rubber on I’m stretching that
Rich niggas tippin', broke niggas lookin'
And it ain't a strip club if they ain't showin' pussy
(... Baby...ha ha ah... Juicy I got ya)
(UGH)
Pop that pussy for a real nigga
Pull out my black card, that's my lil' nigga
Make a movie with your bitch, Steven Spiel nigga
Smoking on Keysh, Cole, gimme me chills nigga
What's your real name? And not your stripper name
I make it rain on ya, like a windowpane
Bandz a make her dance, Tunechi make her cum
Hit-it-from-the-side-like-a-mother-fucking-bass-drum
Two hoes on one fucking pole, two hoes on my fucking pole
I don't tip, I pay bills, bitches call me Buffalo
Her stomach in and her ass out
I'm flyer than the ones they pass out
If money grow on trees, I branched out
I'm just waiting on my bitch to cash out (Ha ha)
(...just waiting for my bitch to cash out
Tunechi... Young Mula Baby)
(2 Chainz)
2 Chainz, four bracelets
Let me see that ass clap; standing ovation
If yo girl don't swallow kids, man, that ho basic
Got 2 bitches wit me: take a shot of one ho, using her friend for a chaser
Bandz a make her bust it, let me see you touch it
Money talk, you ain't got none, end of discussion
(Bandz a make her do it, pocket full of money
Young nigga gettin' head while the engine runnin'
Let me see you wiggle, do it for a real nigga
I be laughing to the bank, all you do is giggle
Ballin' in my coupe, call it sports car
Drop the top and freak it, treat that bitch just like a porn star
