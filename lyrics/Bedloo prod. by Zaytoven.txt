Hook



I don't know what car to drive today (Awman!)

I don't know what shirt to wear today (Awman!)

I don't know what girl I want today

What should I do? You choose I'm bedloo, that's what we do (x2)



Versace, the Louie, the bally

I don't know what to do so I hit bedloo

What should I wear the Rollie the

Breitling the diamonds they shining my ears

Whip in the Jaguar, hop in the lear

They vote on me like i'm the mayor

Or should I smoke gas and sip medicine

They vote on me like I'm the president

I'm counting on Bedloo to pick out my mamacita for my photoshoot

I'm overdue I'm rocking Versace with chains so how can they notice you

Kicking it old school 20 chains on Mr.T fool

How many hundos, should I bring out the bando hit Bedloo





Gianni Versace or Dolce Gabbana my shoes and my shades Givenchy

I got the Grinch on christmas (GAS!) Who stole the pack?(I did it)

My girl, she trippin she irking me she want the Birkin bag color is burgundy

The Gucci pair leathers and Louboutin my footsteps it look like a murder scene

I wake up and scroll on my iPhone 5 and then I click on Bedloo

Blood diamonds we call 'em Clifford, water blue diamonds Blue's Clues

Vintage all on my torso, vintage all in my wardrobe

Jacuzzi we at the top floor, ???
