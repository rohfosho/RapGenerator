[Hook]
All this ice leave me blinded
Five star life, stay reminded
Bitch I done grinding
I pull up with designer if you with it lean behind it
All these lights leave you blinded
Five star life, stay reminded
Bitch I done grinding
I pull up with designer if you with it lean behind it

[Verse 1]
Bitch I'm cruising down the black lodge with black wrist watch
Got a bad bitch sipping scotch popping tick-tocks
Pull up with a black car gotta hit the snack bar
Mitsubishi cruising down the lanes like its NASCAR
They say I'm too bizarre, but I done make it this far
Might smoke a fat jetpack out to Myanmar
Feeling like a movie star, counting stacks with my boys in a sushi bar
Uh no you won't get this far, bitch I bet you know who we are
Wake up and I see dark, never let the dogs bark
Leave you looking like a question mark
I be stuntin' overseas, all my boys ride for lean
Bands to the ceiling, smoke away all my feelings
I be, I be getting rich bitch
I just came to say
Left an addict, I guess I meant that i'm an addict
You can't spit, my money standing looking like cabbage
Ashes steady taking trips living lavish

[Hook x2]
