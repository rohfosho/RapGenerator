[Intro]
*Skit*

[Hook]
I don't wanna be famous, I just wanna be rich
40 mill with some acres, makeup for my bitch
I don't fuck with these niggas, stop pretending and shit
I don't wanna be famous, I just wanna be rich

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be famous
Fuck around, be a Lennon and a fan leave you brainless
All in the paper, gettin' buried  by a neighbor
While all of your relatives spendin' all the money that you gave 'em
Fuck it, don't save 'em
Let that boy drown if he don't float, guess he wasn't made for it
My nigga hold it, hold it down, listenin' to underground
Poppin' knuckles cause these niggas wanna bring me down
Put your face in the dirt like 4th down
Niggas wanna test, but we will never fail
I'm layin' low in my day clothes
Can't get a fuckin' meal at Pollo Loco without takin' photos
Man, these little crazy niggas (loco)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna be famous
Flip a finger, middle finger, let 'em know that I'm dangerous
All my niggas bangers, Chevy riding swingers
And my bitch'll fight ya, Hilary Swank ya
Take your bitch, we ain't even swingers
Nigga, try your luck, think it's all entertainment
You all in arraignment, snitchin' to the plaintiff
Who, what, where? My niggas stay nameless
Knock down yo' doo' for that dough
My niggas they go when I say go
These bitches fuckin' cause they hoes
They hoes for that motherfuckin' fame

[Hook]

[Outro]
We don't fuck with you, we don't fuck with you
I don't need the proof
We don't fuck with you, we don't fuck with you
Nigga, that's the proof
Niggas talkin', that's bulletproof
Run and shoot
Niggas talkin' like they bulletproof
My niggas, they run and shoot

[Skit]
