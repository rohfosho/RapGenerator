Yeah grew up with killers, I didn't know they was killers
We was just together man, playing Mega-man on Sega man
Your mama loved me to death, she reminded me of Afeni
Yeah real black queen
If I had a genie
I wish that she ain't struggle no more
Y'all wouldn't have to go to sleep with all the roaches if she wasn't so poor
You told me when you came to my house
This shit was like a timeout from reality
One night you asked me what I'm crying about
'cuz you was staying over for the weekend
I woke up from out my sleep
When I heard mama and my stepfather beefin
I don't know if he been drinkin
But I know this shit got loud and I heard rumbling from struggling
And rolling on the ground
Could never get used to that sound
My mama saying get off me
My tears is tumbling now
I wish that you never saw me
'Cuz I felt like a coward, so powerless I was only 12
I wish I would've bust through that door my fucking self
And grab the Glock right off the fucking shelf
If nothing else scared a nigga shitless
There goes two of my wishes
Forever scarred, determined to get some heart
No matter how big the nigga, no matter how small you are
Fast-forward to our older years
Two different paths
You used to talk to me about college but that shit didn't last
Waste of potential, getting cash, what could I say?
So tired of not having things, you never see it my way
Too proud to fold
Your demise
One day much to my surprise, my nigga called me, told me you just caught a body twice your size
I asked if it was self defense, he said it was defense of pride
And that they trying to give you ten, but if you lucky you'll do five damn
Not my nigga
The same one that told me that things always get better
Just trust me, don't cry my nigga
The news call him a killer, but he my nigga
Sad shit
Ay yo genie last wish, free my nigga
