Ok, ok now we finna crank up (Oh my God)

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Yeah, Swae
Dressin' like we rich, filthy rich, just lit up a spliff
You not smokin' loud, keep that to your motherfuckin' self
I'm jumpin' off the roof with the African Vodka
Make your baby mama do the macarena, woah
Lookin' in the mirror young nigga so dope
Man 12 came bangin' at the door, woah
Auto park the Audi, if I shit on you I'm sorry
Take your main bitch in a heart beat
She want me to see her body like my name Ozzy
I'ma hit her with the kamikaze
Then I'm bout to hit it in my Alexander
I don't know why you niggas playin'
When you know them young niggas fuckin' show up any minute

[Hook: Swae Lee]

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
Slim
Flexin' like you rich, filthy rich, but you not legit
Take a look around, it ain't too many real niggas left
I'm hotter than whoever or whatever, it don't matter
If I said it, then I motherfuckin' mean it
I'm towerin' in the clouds lookin' down at you clowns
I been up here for a motherfuckin' minute
Drive the 'Rari backwards
I took flexin' to a whole 'nother level
Get so high, gotta run it by NASA
Pockets so fat on my before and after picture
Should I send the money sky divin'
Franck Muller perfect timin'
I don't know why you niggas playin'
When you know them young niggas bout to show up any minute

[Hook: Swae Lee]
