Is it real?

Is it fake?

I woke up, suddenly I just woke up



Look, yo, it only makes sixth sense

They sleep on the creator of Pineal Gland

No offense taken, I’m just racin’, the savior of man

Crucifix, positive, addition, it’s all the same

Given that getting head is cool, but what is it if you don’t use your brain

That’s one plane, negative subtraction, but still a balance

If dyslexic then play this shit backwards

Uh, the black lip captain of the ship

When you dividing the pie, rats come, it’s all math son

So is it really really real? Or do you need to shapen up my G?

I’m a tree, you know peace be still

The irony of my movement, they eyeing my every movement

The pioneer of the future, another Statik selection

With a dab of perfection

Whether it’s wax in your bong or your eardrum

I’m here now, I’m guessing you live in fear now

So be it, when they speak about the real Soul be it, no debate

Don’t just give ‘em the fish, teach ‘em to fish, let ‘em pro-create Shout out to Joey and ‘em, was dope before the cake

I went from selling records out my record shop

To my record selling out the record shop

That’s a paradox like a pair of yachts





It’s hard to be optimistic when Connor’s your opposition

Ain’t no competition, you just a confident contradiction

And what I am in the future, refuse to dispute it

I’ll prove it through music and all you dudes can do is salute it

The most authentic, they get lost in it, I spit raw venom

Jump when I say jump, I feel like Kriss Kross, nigga

Never average, cut from different fabric, fans they never last

My shit’s eternal

Moving so fast that I probably won’t notice a hurdle

Look, Best of the best expect nothing less on my quest

To save the game, I’m walking around like there’s an “S” on my chest

It’s Aftermath out here acting bad, I wave the flag

We the only thing moving, the fuck you go’ say to that?

No lies, all truth, make all you call truce

Watch all just fall off like you tossed off a tall roof

For getting this verse off I paid the cost of the lawsuit

‘Cause I keep hitting them hard with these lines and they all through

Connor





Another day another dollar from that 9 to 5

Yeah, you living but ask yourself, are you really alive?

I worked outside, I worked with food, I worked behind the desk

I’ve even hustled around my block, but hold up, I digress

I’ve paid my dues, see this life I didn’t choose

My face on the ten o'clock news, shit I refuse

I was born in a lower class, where gangsters with dough amass

And police would ask questions, but we never answered when asked

Momma bitching while my sister baby daddy cooking crack in the kitchen

Getting rich in the street from slanging prescription

He showed me how to cook it, he showed me how to cut it

But deep down I always knew that life just wouldn’t cut it

So I started writing, it was a dark time

Only fifteen, but the shit I seen would blow your mind

School was getting harder due to my life at home

Principal always calling ‘cause I had barely shown

No father figure, my mother tried her best to be both

But let’s be honest a father really helps with your growth

But I was raised by Nas and Jay-Z and Big L and Eminem

All of them set examples through they lyrics

Listen close so I could hear it, about life and how not to fear it

How to grab the wheel and steer it, and so I

And so I did just that

Word of advice follow your dreams and never look back

I said it’s Logic
