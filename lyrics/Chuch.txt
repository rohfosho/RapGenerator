Take a bong ripper, I be tuned in

Nick at Nite, Jack Tripper, yeah he gone in

Dimethyltryptamine, tryna see the vivid screens

Never been akin to these lame rappers, they shit is weak

And fuck who you pretend to be, I'm tryna be the bigger me

Body the industry, fuck all my enemies

Got acid in the freezer, acid in the fridge

Acid in the bottle, so don't ask me how I live

Trippy all day, I ain't never gonna slip

There's rules to the game, ho nigga get hip

Hip hip, like that shit that I'm spittin

And I'm on my shit, bruh

Tryna get advances and mansions

Whole family like Manson

Eating rappers like panson

The truth, I'm the answer

The proof in the pudding

Real niggas saluting, they shooting

They said we wasn't gonna do it, drop another one

We outta heat, what the fuck you think I do this for?

The big three and every day it's like I fuckin' ball

Protect your neck and guard your grill, man

Wall off the, yeah I'm synced that means my shit is awesome

Never cared though so fuck, fuck your opinion

Smoke another bowl while I'm laughing at you critics

Ain't shit change, just the numbers on the cane

Got them 47's, eight .9 Glocks, mac-11's

Thirty eight .38's, do you get the message?



They talking but I don't hear it

Fuck in my fear, and fuck the other rappers you comparing

This shit hip with fear and any nigga you think can't even come near it

These niggas finicky, they think we gimmicky cause at first our shit was a banger

And we infiltrated the industry, it's funny cause eventually

They understand I'm not a mere man, more like an entity

Comes from a different fiber, generate radiant energy

Myself in five years, that's the only one ahead of me

I'm from the Mecca, New York, New York

Named it twice, cause we fucking beasts

Zombie gang, walking dead, no man alive

Can't fuck with thee, ya'll niggas got some nerve

We did in a week what you couldn't do in some years

Nigga you ain't learn, I'll make you bite the curb

Get it? Learning curb, amazing with these words

Already got mine, but nigga I'm taking yours

Growing pains, I never felt

Shit I been numb since I was young, the chosen one

Deborah's only son, 1989 she gave birth to a loaded gun

I know I'm blunt, speaking of blunt, I roll it up and smoke it

Some say the proof is in books, some say the proof it is hidden

I bet Eminem and a reverend will tell you Proof is in heaven

Life's a matter of preference, who's to say that hell isn't heaven?

Annually, I dwell in thought darker than the other side of the spectrum

Damn, Arc, give me a second, a milisecond, fuck it, we're never stressing
