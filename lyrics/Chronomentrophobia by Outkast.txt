Chronomentrophobia... The fear of clocks... The fear of time



High as the cost of living

I take what I've been given

Pastor say "be strong"

Ooh hey hey

I ain't got time leave me alone

I ain't got much time left

I've got to funk you now



Chronomentrophobia, chronomentrophobia

Chronomentrophobia, chronomentrophobia

Chronomentrophobia, chronomentrophobia

Chronomentrophobia, chronomentrophobia



Lord be havin mercy on my soul

I'm havin the impression that my life gon be a bowl

Of cherries but its very hard for me to cope

Got tired of bein broke

This ATLien ain't got no time to sit and mope

Made up my mind while y'all made up y'all beds

On a cold wooden floor is where I laid my head

Born in 1975 never thought I'd make it this far

Still battlin in this racial war

Tryin to find solutions to the situation I'm facin

Only thing thats free is my flow that y'all be chasin

Lettin my niggas know before I go I drop that knowledge

Like droppin books lets stop the crooks

From robbin you of your brains and such usin welfare as a crutch

I'm in it for good you into my hood you won't be findin much

Hope that when I'm gone y'all remember this

What we stood for "fuck that fame and that glitz"

It's beginnin to look a lot like the endin

And got to be more careful know what corners you be bendin

Revelations gettin impatient and now I'm dead

Remember what I said I'm gone bow ya heads
