Take yourself a picture when I'm standing at the mound
And I swear it's going down, I'm just repping for my town
Off a cup of C.J Gibson, man I'm faded off the brown
And I’m easily influenced by the niggas I'm around
See that Aston Martin, when I start it hear the sound
I ain't never graduated, I ain't got no cap and gown
But the girls in my class who were smart enough to pass
Be at all my fucking parties, grabbing money off the ground
Yeah, all hail Mr. Lyrical
Spades or the Opus, baby, what you got a feeling for?
I can show you new things, have you feeling spiritual
Pastor Kerney Thomas to these hoes - miwacles
Yeah, ok, they say that I'm the one, in fact
Some say that I'm their favourite
But I ain't hearing none of that
I’m about my team, ho, Young Money running back
Cash Money superstar, where the fuck is Stunna at?
Damn
Untouchable 40 with my AK
Mastermind, big money heavy weight
On the grind, flipping money in every way
Headline, my bitch shine everyday
Pearl white Don P, Marc Jacobs gloves
Cartier Louis case with a dope plod
From the mud where they what you leave in your blood
Going in, flipping hundreds get the young plug
Show ‘em where it go
Floating on the floor, getting more dough
Grind hard, go, black diamond show, watch the flame blow
And how you stay grounded? Cash no go
And how you stay mounded? Cash no flow
And how you stay shining? Bentley off the floor
And how you stay high? Purple pine dro
Diamond minks, fur, February snow
Uhh, you know you paid when you got Baby with ya
It's Young Money like Ben Frank's baby pictures
I’m a lady twister I kiss her whiskers
I been running this shit - blisters
Sticking to the script: movie star money
And if you gassed up, I leave the car running
I’m a big smoker, I’m a little drinker
My peace sign is just the trigger and the middle finger
Wha-what you know about it, man ya’ll clueless
I let two women ride me, that's car-poolers
I rock stupid ice, Mr. Water Coolers
If y'all in the building then we are intruders
Simmer down pimpin', let me handle this
I know the game - analyst
Man I’m the shit, And y'all janitors
Blow out the kush and crack a smile for the cameras
