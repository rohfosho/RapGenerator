Ayo

Planes, trains, automobiles

The G500s with the auto-roll wheels

Pinot Grigio, got 'em on chill

See now, see me ho? I got that deal

If you tryna build, I bet you'd like to know that

My father was a Black Panther with Geronimo Pratt

And back in college, I ain't run with no frat

I just ran with the track that put the Chi on the map

Now the Roc in the buildin', UIC Pavilion

Two years ago I was just a civilian

Now every chick in here swear I got millions

In area codes with unidentified children



Hold up, I'm fuckin' up the rap



Every chick in here swear I got millions

In area codes with unidentified children

Put my hoodie on, blend in like a chameleon

Hear barbershop talk, niggas try to kill him

Take my hoodie off, they like "Ye waddup, you chillin'!"

Swear to god they just like children

Just like high school, back at my school

Just like Halloween minus the costumes

The niggas that's flickin' was the ones that's trickin'

The girls two seatin' was the ones that's treatin'

Do a test on relationship, everybody cheatin'

I used to want the Jordans that's most recent

Now I throw Jordans on the whip just to look decent

Just to get pulled over by the precinct, so frequent

It's like I'm back bein' a delinquent

They wanna know where I live, stay, and work

Why a young black nigga get all these perks

How I stack my paper, got Adidas in every flavor

Excuse me officer, I don't know Rod Laver

Or Stan Smith, what they don't understand is

How I got that color in canvas
