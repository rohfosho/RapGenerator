[Verse 1: Childish Gambino/Donald Glover]
Kingdom Animalia, Phylum Chordata
The Class is Mamalia, 'cos boobies, we gotta

[Verse 2: Danny Pudi]
Order is Primate, Family Hominidae
The genus is Homo, but you know you're into me

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino/Donald Glover]
Because I am in the species known as Sapien
Dogs used to eat me, but now they bring the paper in

[Verse 4: Betty White]
It's going to take a lot to get me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

[All together]
I bless the rains down in Africa X3
