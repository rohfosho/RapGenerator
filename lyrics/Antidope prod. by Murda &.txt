What-you-want : Mi-go!

No, no, no

Migo!

Go!



Call me what you want but you can't call me broke

Pull up with that choppa and a telescope

Got 50  chickens in with me, runnin' around in my city

Young rich nigga trappin' out Bentleys, rich nigga trappin' out Bentleys

We makin' a motion picture, Michelangelo

I'm seein' the snakes in the grass - shhh !

I got the antidope, antidope, antidope, antidope

Antidope, antidope, antidope, antidope



Yo, Quavo

I got the antidope try to come juuggin' and I'm bustin' your cantaloupe

I'm trappin' out of the bando, still got tools like Rambo

I'm feelin' like Harry Houdini

The pack was just here did you see it

The plug he be here any second now

If he didn't then something went down

We losing our bags, gotta go to the stash

At the age of 19, I was running from the task

Put it on my mama, no flex, no brag

Young nigga been had cash

Just me and Rel Money got rich off a half a bag

That's why they mad





I got the antidope

I'm feelin' like Scarface, Al Pacino comin' off a banana boat

And how the fuck 200 Migo touchin' down in Mexico

Fuckin' around with Eduardo, told me that he know Armando

Armando fuckin' with Carlos, Carlos wrappin' em up in the barcodes

Ridin' around with that Scotty in brand new Bugattis

OG Miley Cyrus, snakes tryna give me the virus

But I got that antidope like I know science but I'm no scientist

Fuckin' around with them bombs but I am no terrorist

Piss on your bitch that R Kelly shit

I'm on Mount Everest sippin' on medicine





Austin Powers, you niggas be takin' my Mojo

Young nigga I got the antidope

Coke and baking soda minerals

I got a brick in the figure 4

Young nigga I never make honor roll

But I know how to add up them digits

Whippin' and cookin' and flippin' chickens

You say you got money but pussy nigga you dont have a witness

Cause I've never seen it

I'm a rich nigga I mean it

Keep talkin' bullets go through yo' beanie

I'm in a Phantom Ghost call that shit Casper

Young nigga plugged in like adapters

Stomp yo' ass out like an Alpha

Ahead of you niggas you still in the first chapter
