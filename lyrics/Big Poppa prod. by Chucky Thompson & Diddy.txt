To all the ladies in the place with style and grace

Allow me to lace these lyrical douches in your bushes

Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies?

The back of the club sipping Moët is where you'll find me

The back of the club, macking hoes, my crew's behind me

Mad question asking, blunt passing, music blasting

But I just can't quit

Cause one of these honies Biggie gots to creep with

Sleep with, keep the ep a secret, why not?

Why blow up my spot cause we both got hot?

Now check it: I got more mack than Craig and in the bed

Believe me sweetie, I got enough to feed the needy

No need to be greedy, I got mad friends with Benzes

C-notes by the layers, true fucking players

Jump in the Rover and come over, tell your friends jump in the GS3

I got the chronic by the tree



(I love it when you call me big pop-pa)

Throw your hands in the air, if you's a true player

(I love it when you call me big pop-pa)

To the honies getting money playing niggas like dummies

(I love it when you call me big pop-pa)

If you got a gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place! (why?)

Cause I see some ladies tonight who should be having my baby, baby



Straight up honey really I'm asking

Most of these niggas think they be mackin', but they be acting

Who they attracting with that line, "what's your name, what's your sign?"

Soon as he buy that wine, I just creep up from behind

And ask what your interests are, who you be with

Things that make you smile, what numbers to dial

You gon' be here for a while?

I'm gon' go call my crew, you go call your crew

We can rendezvous at the bar around 2

Plans to leave, throw the keys to Lil Cease

Pull the truck up front, and roll up the next blunt

So we can steam on the way to the telly, go fill my belly

A T-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape

Conversate for a few, cause in a few, we gon' do

What we came to do, ain't that right boo? (true)

Forget the telly, we just go to the crib

And watch a movie in the jacuzzi, smoke L's while you do me





How you livin' Biggie Smalls?

In mansion and Benzes

Givin' ends to my friends and it feels stupendous

Tremendous cream: fuck a dollar and a dream

Still tote Gats strapped with infrared beams

Chopping O's, smoking la in Optimos

Money, hoes and clothes: all a nigga knows

A foolish pleasure? Whatever

I had to find the buried treasure, so grams I had to measure

However living better now, Coogi sweater now

Drop top BM's, I'm the man, girlfriend



Honey, check it

Tell your friends to get with my friends

And we can be friends

Shit, we can do this every weekend, aight?

Is that aight with you?
