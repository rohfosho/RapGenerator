Hello? Raping You Records?

Nah I ain't trying to sign



After this year I'll probably have a couple more friends

Couple more attention seekers trying to sneak up in the Benz

Ain't no space in the two-seater, choose either the coupe or your plans

Quit playing, the gameboy's in the palm of my hand

I might flex, just to show niggas who the fuck I am

Cocaina pure on the Pacific beaches and sand

What's better, than saying I would be and now I am

What's better, than watching the little bro become the man

Vic

Save Money
