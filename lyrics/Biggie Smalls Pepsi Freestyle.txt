Hey yo, Enuff, man! What you got to drink up in here, man? I'm thirsty
Big slam, quick slam, tin can, whatever
Whether too cold or too hot, you got to keep Pepsi in the freezer
I keep a 3 liter for my crew
My girl like them diet joints too
For when she watch her weight, crack the top I can't wait
Other sodas taste the worst -- I don't even converse
If it can't quench my thirst what you in my fridge for?
What you wanna live for? Life with the dry mouth
Hot like the south, flash out ya 12 ounce and renounce
Nothing can beat the P-e-p-s-i
Yes I drink it constantly; cop it by the case, tastes great, less filling
Non-alcoholic I can feed it to my children
Tell em Biggie said, "Drink it all"; don't test me!
Nothing else beats a Pepsi, if it is, let's see..I'm thirstyHey yo, Enuff, man! What you got to drink up in here, man? I'm thirsty
