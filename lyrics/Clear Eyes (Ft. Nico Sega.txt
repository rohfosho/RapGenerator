It’s been a while since my boys looked at me with clear eyes
It’s been a while since my voice became shaky with sniffle cries
It’s been a while since my boys looked at me with clear eyes
It’s been a while since my voice became shaky with sniffle cries

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Wide-eyed and dizzy walking
Another night another hangover
Another day of being broke I dreamt I had a range rover
Them 40 oz keep me drowning in the King Cobra
I'm peering on keep on staring over the same shoulder
Same soldier, I guess I never strayed too far
I mean I never lost my way
But if there’s one thing I've learned your problems follow you wherever you are
So really ain’t no point in running away
It's hard to say I keep an open mind
At least I try to when I can
Sometimes it's hard when you're mourning on the loss of your man
This past summer I was close though, an inch from my death
That's why I sentence to the most and thank God for this breath

[Hook]
Walking away-ay, Walking along-ong
I was getting paid-aid, but something was wrong-ong
Nothing to say-ay, You should've known-own
An inch to today-ay, I'm all on my own-own

It’s been a while (x8)

It’s been a while since my boys looked at me with clear eyes
It’s been a while since my voice became shaky with sniffle cries
It’s been a while since my boys looked at me with clear eyes
It’s been a while since my voice became shaky with sniffle cries
